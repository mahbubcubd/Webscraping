If you are NOT using CORS requests to your APIs, please ignore this announcement.Important: The changes in this release do not effect deployments on Google App Engine Standard.Background & Current BehaviorWith the CORS standard, a browser inserts an extra OPTIONS request to the server to determine whether it has permission to perform a cross-origin request. Currently the ESP always accepts OPTIONS requests. This means that currently ESP always allows cross-origin requests through CORS.Upcoming ChangesESP will allow service producers to specify whether or not to allow cross-origin traffic. By default, ESP will block cross-origin requests by rejecting all OPTIONS requests. If you want to allow cross-origin requests for your API, you will need to add the following snippet to the service\'s OpenAPI configuration....\n""host"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",\n""x-google-endpoints"": [\n  {\n    ""name"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",\n    ""allowCors"": true\n  }\n],\n...\nImportant: This is a breaking change. By default ESP will now reject cross-origin calls unless the above ""allowCors"" setting is applied.What You Need to DoNote: This change does not apply to App Engine Standard Environment. Standard Environment uses Endpoints Frameworks. CORS traffic is allowed on this platform.Follow the instructions in the appropriate tab below.\nApp Engine FlexAfter ESP 1.0 is released on January 2, 2017, all Flexible Environment API deployments will feature the new version of ESP and will automatically disallow CORS requests by default. App Engine applications are automatically redeployed every 7 days, so sometime in the 7 days following the release of ESP 1.0, your app will be restarted with the latest version and will automatically be protected from unintended cross origin sharing.\nIf you are using Flexible Environments and would like to continue to allow CORS requests, you must add the ""x-google-endpoints"" snippet above to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file). If you are relying on CORS, we recommend that you add the snippet as soon as possible and redeploy your service using the following command to avoid service interruption. Then you will not see changed behavior when the new version of ESP rolls out.\ngcloud app deploy app.yaml\n\nKubernetes EngineWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.\nNote: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.\nIf you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0 after January 2. Add the above ""x-google-endpoints"" snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.\ngcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml\n\nNote that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.\nNow you need to redeploy your service. You can use the following command, replacing ESP-DEPLOYMENT with the deployment name for your service.\nkubectl edit deployment/ESP-DEPLOYMENT\n\nThis command opens up your GKE configuration YAML and let you update the deployment. Make sure to change your version of ESP to 1.0 and update the SERVICE_CONFIG_ID to the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, and save the deployment.\ncontainers:\n    - name: esp\n      image: gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1.0\n      args: [\n        ""--http_port"", ""8080"",\n        ""--backend"", ""localhost:8081"",\n        ""--service"", ""SERVICE_NAME"",\n        ""--version"", ""SERVICE_CONFIG_ID"",\n      ]\n\nCompute EngineWe plan to introduce this change in the ESP version 1.0 release on January 2, 2017.\nNote: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.\nIf you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0. Add the above ""x-google-endpoints"" snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.\ngcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml\nNote that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.\nBefore redeploying your service, you need to update the metadata entries on the VM with the following command:\ngcloud compute instances add-metadata --metadata=endpoints-service-name=SERVICE_NAME,endpoints-service-config-id=SERVICE_CONFIG_ID\n\nThen you need to SSH to the VM and run the following command to restart ESP.\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\n\nAlternatively, if you use the start_esp.py script to start ESP (instead of the init.d script), you can stop ESP and re-run the start_esp.py command with the updated SERVICE_CONFIG_ID.\nCompute Engine + DockerWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.\nNote: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.\nIf you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (known as the OpenAPI specification or Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0. Add the above x-google-endpoints snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.\ngcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml\n\nThis pushes your new service config to Google Service Management. That command will return a new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for your API. Note it down because you will need it in the next step.\nNext, redeploy your service. First stop and remove the current ESP instance (e.g., ""esp"") using the following commands. You can use sudo docker ps command to find out the current ESP instance.\nsudo docker stop esp\nsudo docker rm esp\n\nThen, run the following command to redeploy ESP. Make sure to use the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for -v option.\nsudo docker run --name=esp -d -p 80:8080 --link=echo:echo gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1.0 -s [SERVICE_NAME] -v [SERVICE_CONFIG_ID] -a echo:8081\n'}]"

If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.\nFor more details, see the auto scaling documentation.\n\n'}, {'release_date': 'March 28, 2018', 'content': OrderedDict([('@type', 'html'), ('#text', '<strong class=""release-note-product-version-title"">1.12+</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Go SDK to version 1.9.64.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>App Engine flexible environment applications that declare <code>runtime: go</code> in their <code>app.yaml</code> configuration file now deploy with the Go 1.10 runtime.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong class=""release-note-product-version-title"">1.11</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Go SDK to version 1.9.64.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>App Engine flexible environment applications that declare <code>runtime: go</code> in their <code>app.yaml</code> configuration file now deploy with the Go 1.10 runtime.</li>\n</ul>')]), 'status': 'Feature', 'description': '1.12+\nFeature\n\nUpdated Go SDK to version 1.9.64.\n\nFeature\n\nApp Engine flexible environment applications that declare runtime: go in their app.yaml configuration file now deploy with the Go 1.10 runtime.\n\n1.11\nFeature\n\nUpdated Go SDK to version 1.9.64.\n\nFeature\n\nApp Engine flexible environment applications that declare runtime: go in their app.yaml configuration file now deploy with the Go 1.10 runtime.\n'}, {'release_date': 'March 19, 2018', 'content': OrderedDict([('@type', 'html'), ('#text', '<strong class=""release-note-product-version-title"">1.12+</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Go SDK to version 1.9.63.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Added beta support for version 1.9 of the Go runtime.</p>\n\n<p>You can try out Go 1.9 by specifying <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/config/appref#api_version""><code>api_version: go1.9</code></a> in your <code>app.yaml</code> configuration file.</p>\n\n<p>To use the 1.9 beta version, you must first update your Go SDK to 1.9.63 or later.

Please follow the following steps:Disable auto-upgrade on the Windows node pool(s). When the first step is complete, Google will restart the cluster auto-upgrade. Please note that this could take a few days. The cluster's master and the Linux node pool(s) will be upgraded. The Windows node pool will not get upgraded as auto-upgrade is disabled in step number one. After the cluster master upgrade is complete and you have rebuilt your container images, manually upgrade your Windows node pool. After completing step number three, you can turn back on the auto-upgrade option. If you choose to turn the auto-upgrade option back on, please use multi-arch (or multi-platform) images to take advantage of the auto-upgrade feature.Incompatibility issues such as this one are a rare occurrence as it is against Microsoft's typical guidance for the security updates. Rest assured that if such issues occur again, we will keep you posted. Please stay up to date with GKE's release notes for the latest info.If you have any questions or require assistance, please email us or contact Google Cloud Support.""}, {'release_date': 'April 1, 2020', 'content': OrderedDict([('@type', 'html'), ('#text', '<h3 data-text=""Version updates"" id=""version_updates_5"" tabindex=""0"">Version updates</h3><p>GKE cluster versions have been updated.</p><p><aside class=""note"">Note: Your clusters might not have these versions available.

For example, --metadata GCS_CONNECTOR_VERSION=2.0.0.\n\nChanged\n\nNew Dataproc image versions: 1.2.85-debian9, 1.3.45-debian9, 1.4.16-debian9, 1.3.45-ubuntu18, 1.4.16-ubuntu18, and Preview.\n\nNote that Dataproc 1.1 will have no further releases.\n\nUpdate Conscrypt library to 1.4.2\nFailed Jobs error messages now include a link to the logs in the Cloud Console rather than to the Google Cloud Storage directory containing them.\n1.3 image\n\nUpgrade Spark to 2.3.4.\n\n1.4 image\n\nUpgrade Hive to 2.3.6.\nApply SPARK-28921 to prevent Spark jobs from failing on newer versions of Kubernetes (1.15.3, 1.14.6, 1,13.10, 1.12.10, 1.11.10)\n\nPreview image\n\nHadoop 2.10\nSpark 2.4.4\nHive 2.3.6\nPig 0.17.0\nTez 0.9.2\nCloud Storage Connector 2.0.0\nPython 3.7\nScala 2.12.0\nAnaconda3 5.3.0\nDruid 0.16\nHive Webhcat 2.3.2\nJupyter 4.5.0\nKerberos 1.15.1\nPresto 324 (prestosql)\nZeppelin 0.9.0-SNAPSHOT\nZookeeper 3.4.13\n\n\nBreaking\nBreaking Changes:\n\nDataproc will no longer accept requests to create new clusters using Debian 8 images. Existing clusters that are using Debian 8 can still be used and scaled.\nThe alpha version of the Kerberos optional component option has been removed from the v1beta2 API. To use Kerberos, please configure it via the SecurityConfig message instead.\nDisallow setting or overriding goog-dataproc-* labels when creating or updating clusters. All attempts to set goog-dataproc-* labels on creation will be ignored. Any existing custom goog-dataproc-* labels on running clusters will be removed if cluster labels are updated, and attempts to add new custom goog-dataproc-* labels to existing clusters will be ignored.\nReset autoscaling if the same or a new autoscaling policy is attached to a cluster. E.g. through gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<policy-name>. Note that resetting autoscaling does not change the cluster's status. Autoscaling will only run while the cluster's status is RUNNING or UPDATING, and does not work if the cluster is in ERROR. In addition, if the cluster was previously resizing (UPDATING), the autoscaler will not be able to scale the cluster until the previous update operation has completed.\n\nAlso fixes an issue where autoscaling would not reset correctly if autoscaling was disabled then re-enabled with the same within 30 seconds. Running gcloud dataproc clusters update --disable-autoscaling and then gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<same-policy> should now correctly reset autoscaling regardless of how long autoscaling was disabled.\n\n\nFixed\n\nFixed race condition where deleting a cluster shortly after updating it would not delete all of the cluster's VMs\nAllow compute resource names with an Alpha API version. For example: https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/alpha/projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network.\n\nThis allows gcloud alpha dataproc clusters create <cluster-name> --network=my-network to succeed, since gcloud sets the compute API version to the same as the gcloud command track.\n\n""}, {'release_date': 'October 31, 2019', 'content': OrderedDict([('@type', 'html'), ('#text', '<h3>Feature</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Announcing the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages#launch-stages"">General Availability (GA)</a> release of <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1beta2/projects.regions.jobs#SparkRJob"">SparkR jobs on Cloud Dataproc</a>.

This field is populated automatically for requests made over HTTP.\nSeveral repeated fields now have plural names:\n\nIn message CompositeFilter, filter is now filters.\nIn message QueryResultBatch, entity_result is now entity_results.\nIn message LookupRequest, key is now keys.\nIn message AllocateIdsRequest, key is now keys.\nIn message AllocateIdsResponse, key is now keys.\n\nThe proto package name now includes the API version.\nIn message PartitionId:\n\nField dataset_id is now project_id. project_id never includes the app/project ID ""prefix"" (e.g. ""s~""). This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/59.\nField namespace is now namespace_id.\n\nIn message Key, field path_element is now path.\nIn message Value:\n\nNull values are represented by explicitly setting field null_value with type com.protobuf.NullValue. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.\nField timestamp_microseconds_value is now timestamp_value with type google.protobuf.Timestamp. In JSON, the field dateTimeValue is now timestampValue. This field is still limited to microsecond precision.\nField blob_key_value is removed. Values that previously populated that field in the v1beta1 or v1beta2 APIs will instead populate field string_value in the v1beta3 API.\nField geo_point_value of type google.type.LatLng is added.\nRepeated field list_value is replaced with array_value of type ArrayValue.\nField indexed, which defaulted to true, is now exclude_from_indexes, which defaults to false.\n\nMessage Property is removed. In message Entity, repeated field property is now field properties which is a map from string to Value.\nMessage PropertyExpression is now Projection.\nMessage EntityResult adds a field cursor of type bytes.\nIn message Query:\n\nField group_by is now distinct_on.\nField limit is now of type google.protobuf.Int32Value.\n\nIn message PropertyExpression, enum AggregationFunction and field aggregation_function are removed.\nIn messages CompositeFilter and PropertyFilter, field operator is now op.\nIn message GqlQuery:\n\nField allow_literal is now allow_literals.\nRepeated field name_arg is now map field named_bindings.\nField number_arg is now positional_bindings.\n\nMessage GqlQueryArg is now GqlQueryParameter. Field name is removed.\nEnum MoreResultsType adds a new value MORE_RESULTS_AFTER_CURSOR.\nMessage QueryResultBatch adds field skipped_cursor.\nIn message Mutation:\n\nA Mutation now describes one change to one single entity. Its fields are no longer repeated.\nField insert_auto_id is removed. insert and update mutations now support auto ID allocation.\nField force is removed.\n\nIn message MutationResult:\n\nField index_updates is moved to message CommitResponse.\nRepeated field insert_auto_id_key is now key and is no longer repeated.\n\nMessage RunQueryResponse adds field query. When a RunQueryRequest message sets field gql_query, the RunQueryResponse message sets field query to the parsed form of the GqlQuery message from the request.\nIn message BeginTransactionRequest, enum IsolationLevel and field isolation_level are removed. All transactions are now serializable.\nIn message CommitRequest, field mutation is now repeated field mutations.\nIn message CommitResponse, field mutation_result is now repeated field mutation_results.\n\nChanges to the JSON API:\n\nNull values are now supported. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.\nFields set to their default values are not included in responses, for example:\n\nFields found, missing, and deferred in message to LookupResponse are not included when they are empty.\nField entity_result in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is empty.\nField skipped_results in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is 0.\n\n\nThe API endpoint format has changed. For example, in v1beta2, a RunQuery is sent to: https://www.googleapis.com/datastore/v1beta2/datasets/<dataset-id>/runQuery\nIn v1beta3, it is sent to:\nhttps://datastore.googleapis.com/v1beta3/projects/<project-id>:runQuery\nAccount domain restrictions no longer apply when accessing the API. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.\nErrors:\n\nJSON errors add a status field and remove the errors list.\nErrors resulting from requests with a content type of application/x-protobuf are now a serialized google.rpc.Status message.\n\nChanges to GQL:\n\nIn synthetic literal KEY, DATASET is now PROJECT.\nThe BLOBKEY synthetic literal is removed.\nThe FIRST aggregator is removed.\nThe GROUP BY clause is replaced with DISTINCT ON.\nFully-qualified property names are now supported.\nQuery filters on timestamps prior to the epoch are now supported.\n\nEmpty array values are now supported.\nIndexing and querying properties inside of entity values is now supported. Values inside entity values are indexed by default.\nKey normalization:\n\nIn Key objects in RunQueryRequests, key normalization will never set partition_id.namespace_id, as it previously did under some circumstances. If a key should reference that partition its partition_id.namespace_id must be explicitly set.\nKey objects with empty path and empty or unset partition_id are no longer normalized.\n\nWrites of foreign partition IDs may now fail if the foreign project is not in an active state. For this reason, use of foreign partition IDs is discouraged.\nIn a non-transactional Commit requests, no two mutations may affect the same entity.\nIn transactional Commit requests, mutations affecting the same entity are applied in the order in which they appear in the request. Certain sequences of mutations affecting the same entity are not permitted.\nField more_results in message QueryResultBatch is accurate in more cases. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/48.\nThe typical number of results returned by a call to RunQuery is smaller due to a change in server-side batching. As before, clients should not rely on the batch size and instead use cursors to continue queries.\nScope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email is no longer required.\nThe API works for projects that have an App Engine domain restriction. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.\ngcd tool:\n\nOptions -d, --dataset_id, and --dataset_id_override are now -p, --project_id, and --project_id_override, respectively.\nOption --auth_mode is removed. The updateindexes and vacuumindexes commands always use OAuth 2.0.\nOption --auto_generate_indexes is now --store_index_configuration_on_disk.\nIndex configuration for new projects is now stored in a YAML file: <directory>/WEB-INF/index.yaml. Index configuration for projects that previously used XML will continue to do so.\n\n'}, {'release_date': 'September 01, 2013', 'content': OrderedDict([('@type', 'html'), ('#text', '<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of Cloud Datastore API v1beta2.</li>\n<li>Changes to the API:\n<ul>\n<li><code>BlindWrite</code> method merged into <code>Commit</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>list_value</code> to <code>Value</code> and changed <code>value</code> to a non-repeated field in <code>Property</code>.</li>\n<li>In the JSON API, string constants are now uppercase and underscore-separated instead of camel-cased (e.g. <code>LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL</code> instead of <code>lessThanOrEqual</code>).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Changes to GQL:\n<ul>\n<li>New synthetic literals: <code>BLOB</code>, <code>BLOBKEY</code>, <code>DATETIME</code>, <code>KEY</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for <code>IS NULL</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixed partition ID handling for binding arguments.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Fixed partition ID handling for query requests that include an explicit partition ID.</li>\n<li>Fixed scopes in discovery document.
