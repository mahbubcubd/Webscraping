Image Classification General Availability (GA) release
Some notes about the GA release:

Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge are now in General Availability (GA). The Service Level Agreement has been published.
We've introduced a new version (v1) of the Cloud AutoML API. The current version (v1beta1) is deprecated and is scheduled for deletion within six months. As a result, you will need to migrate your applications from the v1beta1 version to the v1 version. If you have integrated with the Create Dataset API, you will also need to change your code to reflect changes with v1 version integration.

Creating dataset will now return an Operation, whose status must be requested to detect completion.
Both dataset and model can be updated using patch, with a field mask that can include labels and displayName for both, and description only for dataset.
In ModelEvaluation, baseAuPrc has been deprecated. This is the Area Under Precision-Recall Curve metric based on priors.
Specifying an Image is the only option for ExamplePayload of online prediction. The inputConfig option was not supported and has been deleted.

The maximum supported lifespan for custom models created in Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge has changed from two years to 18 months. 
The new pricing for Image Classification is effective November 21, 2019 at 12 AM Pacific Time. For further information, including pricing examples, please refer to our pricing page. 
Image Classification models trained prior to the Beta Refresh release of October 9, 2019, will serve online predictions under the old pricing structure until you redeploy. Online predictions from these models will stop on February 21, 2020, unless you redeploy. 

For more information, see the product documentation."

Avoid Unnecessary Classification Model Deployment Charges at GA

Review each project's Models. You can review your models by: 

Visit the Google Cloud Console project selector dashboard to access each of your projects in turn. 
From each project page, click the top left navigation menu (hamburger icon), scroll down and select Vision dashboard (Artificial Intelligence > Vision). 
From the Vision dashboard, select the Image Classification card under AutoML Vision. If dataset migration has completed for your project, you will be redirected to access the UI shared with Object Detection. Some customers will not be redirected in this step today, and must complete the following steps when redirection works. If you cannot complete them by October 31st, 2019, join the cloud-vision-discuss Google group to request assistance. 

The UI will display your existing Classification models as deployed with '0 nodes'. This indicates that they are still deployed on the old online prediction service. 
Redeploy active Image Classification models or update model's node number to adjust online prediction queries served per second, Each node that is selected for deployment will incur hourly charge of $1.25 (USD) at GA. 
When you are done with these steps, no Classification model should be left in initial state, deployed with '0 nodes'. Each model left in this state will serve online predictions from the old service, but will be excluded from our Service Level Agreement offered at GA, and will be undeployed on February 21, 2020.

Image Classification Beta Refresh
Image Classification Beta Refresh has been released. The unified infrastructure now supports both Classification and Object Detection as model objectives.

Dataset migration for existing Classification projects is ongoing. Unless your project has migrated, the issue published below on September 30, 2019 will continue to be relevant for you. Please follow instructions there.
New  projects created after this release will not have this restriction. Selecting Classification as an option while creating a new dataset in the User Interface for Object Detection will succeed for them.

The following features that Classification customers had been used to will not be available in the unified infrastructure:

Integrated Human labeling; alternatively, you can use Cloud AI Platform Data Labeling Service.
Automated deployment of models will happen if you opt-in; you can manually deploy and set the number of nodes on which your model(s) are deployed. Both the UI and the API support this feature.

Changed
Model deployment & undeployment
Starting with this release, users must deploy their trained models before they are able to make predictions with them. They will also need to undeploy models to avoid incurring deployment charges when Classification models switch to deployment-based pricing for online predictions at General Availability later in 2019.
For more information, see the Deploying models and Undeploying models topics."

New Dataset Issue for Image Classification
On September 30, we begin migrating Classification datasets, prioritizing the projects created since July 2018 beta release of this feature. Following migration, creation of Classification datasets will succeed in the UI for Object Detection for these projects even before the Beta Refresh release. So the above caveats stop applying when dataset migrations is done, and the project is redirected to the unified UI.
The How-to Guides for Object Detection can be used temporarily to understand how tasks such as deploying and undeploying models are done in the unified UI. These changes will be reflected in the Classification documentation by the Beta Refresh release date.
Some caveats until AutoML Vision announces Beta Refresh release:

Selecting Classification as an option while creating a new dataset in the User Interface for Object Detection  will succeed, but will block further progress.
Importing data into this dataset will fail.  These release notes will be updated when this issue has been resolved.
To avoid this issue, please continue creating new Classification datasets in the UI for Image Classification.
Until our Beta Refresh release, separate selection cards for Image Classification and Object Detection will be available in the Vision Dashboard.
Following the release, these two cards will be replaced by single AutoML Vision card, and new Classification datasets will not be subject to this issue.

Object Detection General Availability (GA) release
Some notes about the GA release:

Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge are now in General Availability (GA). The Service Level Agreement has been published.
We've introduced a new version (v1) of the Cloud AutoML API. The current version (v1beta1) is deprecated and is scheduled for deletion within six months. As a result, you will need to migrate your applications from the v1beta1 version to the v1 version. If you have integrated with the Create Dataset API, you will also need to change your code to reflect changes with v1 version integration.

Creating datasets will now return an Operation, whose status must be requested to detect completion.
Both dataset and model can be updated using patch, with a field mask that can include labels and displayName for both, and description only for dataset.
Specifying an Image is the only option for ExamplePayload of online prediction. The inputConfig option was not supported and has been deleted.

The maximum supported lifespan for custom models created in Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge has changed from two years to 18 months.

The Cloud Translation API is no longer taking requests for access to the Premium Edition (Beta). Instead, the premium features of the Cloud Translation API have been made generally available in the Standard Edition.
Feature
You now have access to the robust translation features available using the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. There is no difference in pricing between the standard, Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) model, and the NMT model.
By default, when you make a translation request to the Cloud Translation API, your text is translated using the NMT model. If the NMT model is not supported for the requested language translation pair, or if you explicitly request it, the PBMT model is used.
In order for your request to be translated using the NMT model, you must send your request to the current Translation API endpoint: https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2. The https://www.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2 endpoint does not support the NMT model.
NMT models are computationally intensive and may take more time to translate your query as compared to the same query translated using the PBMT model. If your application is latency sensitive, we recommend that you try both models to determine which best fits your needs for response time.
Feature
The model query parameter has been added to the translate method. You can use the model parameter to explicitly specify the translation model for your request. Specify base to use the PBMT model, and nmt to use the NMT model.
If you do not specify a model parameter for your request, then nmt is used.
If you specify the nmt model, and the requested language translation pair is not supported for the NMT model, then the request is translated using the base model."

Runtime version 2.1 for AI Platform Prediction is now available.
Runtime version 2.1 is the first runtime version to support TensorFlow 2 for online and batch prediction. Specifically, this runtime version includes TensorFlow 2.1.0. Review the updated guide to exporting TensorFlow SavedModels for use with AI Platform Prediction for details about exporting compatible models by using TensorFlow 2 APIs, like Keras.
When you use runtime version 2.1 for online prediction, you can currently only deploy TensorFlow model versions. You cannot deploy scikit-learn, XGBoost, or custom prediction routine artifacts for online prediction with runtime version 2.1. For the time being, continue to use runtime version 1.15 to serve predictions from these types of models.
Runtime version 2.1 is also the first runtime version not to support Python 2.7. The Python Software Foundation ended support for Python 2.7 on January 1, 2020. No AI Platform runtime versions released after January 1, 2020 support Python 2.7.
Issue
If you deploy a model version for online prediction that uses runtime version 2.1 with a GPU, AI Platform Prediction uses TensorFlow 2.0.0 (instead of TensorFlow 2.1.0) to serve predictions.

Runtime version 2.1 also updates many other dependencies; see the runtime version list for more details.
Issue
Runtime version 2.1 includes scikit-learn 0.22 rather than 0.22.1. This is a known issue, and the release notes will be updated when runtime version 2.1 includes scikit-learn 0.22.1.
Feature
When you train with runtime version 2.1 or later, AI Platform Training uses the chief task name to represent the master VM in the  TF_CONFIG environment variable. This environment variable is important for distributed training with TensorFlow. For runtime version 1.15 and earlier, AI Platform Training uses the master task name instead, but this task name is not supported in TensorFlow 2.
However, by default, AI Platform Training continues to use the master task name in custom container training jobs. If you are performing multi-worker distributed training with TensorFlow 2 in a custom container, set the new  trainingInput.useChiefInTfConfig field to true when you create a custom container training job in order to use the chief task name.

Deprecated
Starting January 1, 2020, the Python Software Foundation will no longer support Python 2.7. Accordingly, any runtime versions released after January 1, 2020 will not support Python 2.7.
Changed
Note: The following change has been delayed. There will be an additional announcement to affected customers before it goes into effect.
Starting on January 13, 2020, AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction 
will support each runtime version for one year after its release date. You can find the release date of each runtime version in the runtime version list.
Support for each runtime version changes according to the following schedule:

Starting on the release date: You can create training jobs, batch prediction jobs, and model versions that use the runtime version.
Starting 12 months after the release date: You can no longer create training jobs, batch prediction jobs, or model versions that use the runtime version.
Existing model versions that have been deployed to AI Platform Prediction continue to function.
24 months after the release date: AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes all model versions that use the runtime version.

This policy will be applied retroactively on January 13, 2020. For example, since runtime version 1.0 was released over 24 months ago, AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction no longer support it. There will be a three-month grace period (until April 13, 2020) before AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes model versions that use the oldest runtime versions.
The following table describes the first two important dates that mark the end of support for runtime versions:



Date 
Runtime versions affected

Runtime version 2.1 for AI Platform Prediction is now available.
Runtime version 2.1 is the first runtime version to support TensorFlow 2 for online and batch prediction. Specifically, this runtime version includes TensorFlow 2.1.0. Review the updated guide to exporting TensorFlow SavedModels for use with AI Platform Prediction for details about exporting compatible models by using TensorFlow 2 APIs, like Keras.
When you use runtime version 2.1 for online prediction, you can currently only deploy TensorFlow model versions.

There will be a three-month grace period (until April 13, 2020) before AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes model versions that use the oldest runtime versions.
The following table describes the first two important dates that mark the end of support for runtime versions:



Date 
Runtime versions affected 
Change in functionality




January 13, 2020 
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12
You can no longer create training jobs, batch prediction jobs, or model versions using these runtime versions.


April 13, 2020 
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes any model versions using these runtime versions.



To learn about when availability ends for every runtime version, see the runtime version list.
Changed
Note: The following change has been delayed. There will be an additional announcement to affected customers before it goes into effect.
Starting on January 13, 2020, AI Platform Training will automatically delete the history of each training job 120 days after it is completed. A training job is considered completed when the job enters the SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or CANCELLED state.
This policy will be applied retroactively on January 13, 2020: all jobs that were completed September 15, 2019 or earlier will be deleted.
Changed
Starting on January 13, 2020, runtimeVersion and pythonVersion will become required fields when you create Job or Version resources. Previously, runtimeVersion defaulted to 1.0 and pythonVersion defaulted to 2.7."

Currently, the option is available only in the beta version of the gcloud command line tool.

Endpoints gRPC documentationLibrary and Plugin UpdatesThe Endpoints Frameworks for Python library, version 3.0.0, contains potentially breaking changes. It is now possible to deploy a single service comprising multiple APIs. However, there are additional restrictions on API names when using this functionality. See Deploying and Testing an API for more details.
Previously, API version strings were embedded in the path as-is. For example, an API echo with version v1 would have a path like /echo/v1. This continues to be the case for API version strings that are not compatible with the SemVer standard. If the string is compatible with the SemVer standard, the major version number will be extracted and embedded in the path when you deploy your API. So, for example, an API called echo with version 2.1.0 would have a path like /echo/v2. If you update the echo API to version 2.2.0 and deploy a backwards-compatible change, the path remains /echo/v2. This allows you to update the API version number when you make a backwards-compatible change without breaking existing paths for your clients. But if you update the echo API to version 3.0.0 (because you are deploying a breaking change), the path is changed to /echo/v3."

If you are NOT using CORS requests to your APIs, please ignore this announcement.Important: The changes in this release do not effect deployments on Google App Engine Standard.Background & Current BehaviorWith the CORS standard, a browser inserts an extra OPTIONS request to the server to determine whether it has permission to perform a cross-origin request. Currently the ESP always accepts OPTIONS requests. This means that currently ESP always allows cross-origin requests through CORS.Upcoming ChangesESP will allow service producers to specify whether or not to allow cross-origin traffic. By default, ESP will block cross-origin requests by rejecting all OPTIONS requests. If you want to allow cross-origin requests for your API, you will need to add the following snippet to the service's OpenAPI configuration....
""host"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",
""x-google-endpoints"": [
  {
    ""name"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",
    ""allowCors"": true
  }
],
...
Important: This is a breaking change. By default ESP will now reject cross-origin calls unless the above ""allowCors"" setting is applied.What You Need to DoNote: This change does not apply to App Engine Standard Environment. Standard Environment uses Endpoints Frameworks. CORS traffic is allowed on this platform.Follow the instructions in the appropriate tab below.
App Engine FlexAfter ESP 1.0 is released on January 2, 2017, all Flexible Environment API deployments will feature the new version of ESP and will automatically disallow CORS requests by default. App Engine applications are automatically redeployed every 7 days, so sometime in the 7 days following the release of ESP 1.0, your app will be restarted with the latest version and will automatically be protected from unintended cross origin sharing.
If you are using Flexible Environments and would like to continue to allow CORS requests, you must add the ""x-google-endpoints"" snippet above to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file). If you are relying on CORS, we recommend that you add the snippet as soon as possible and redeploy your service using the following command to avoid service interruption. Then you will not see changed behavior when the new version of ESP rolls out.
gcloud app deploy app.yaml

Kubernetes EngineWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.
Note: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.
If you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0 after January 2. Add the above ""x-google-endpoints"" snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml

Note that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.
Now you need to redeploy your service. You can use the following command, replacing ESP-DEPLOYMENT with the deployment name for your service.
kubectl edit deployment/ESP-DEPLOYMENT

This command opens up your GKE configuration YAML and let you update the deployment. Make sure to change your version of ESP to 1.0 and update the SERVICE_CONFIG_ID to the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, and save the deployment.

gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml
Note that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.
Before redeploying your service, you need to update the metadata entries on the VM with the following command:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata --metadata=endpoints-service-name=SERVICE_NAME,endpoints-service-config-id=SERVICE_CONFIG_ID

Then you need to SSH to the VM and run the following command to restart ESP.
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Alternatively, if you use the start_esp.py script to start ESP (instead of the init.d script), you can stop ESP and re-run the start_esp.py command with the updated SERVICE_CONFIG_ID.
Compute Engine + DockerWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.
Note: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.
If you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (known as the OpenAPI specification or Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0. Add the above x-google-endpoints snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml

This pushes your new service config to Google Service Management. That command will return a new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for your API. Note it down because you will need it in the next step.
Next, redeploy your service. First stop and remove the current ESP instance (e.g., ""esp"") using the following commands. You can use sudo docker ps command to find out the current ESP instance.
sudo docker stop esp
sudo docker rm esp

Then, run the following command to redeploy ESP. Make sure to use the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for -v option.
sudo docker run --name=esp -d -p 80:8080 --link=echo:echo gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1.0 -s [SERVICE_NAME] -v [SERVICE_CONFIG_ID] -a echo:8081

For example, an app can receive requests at https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com. This new URL is optional for existing apps, and will soon be required for all new apps.
To ensure a smooth transition, we are slowly updating App Engine to use region IDs. If we haven't updated your Google Cloud project yet, you won't see a region ID for your app. Since the ID is optional for existing apps, you don't need to update URLs or make other changes once the region ID is available for your existing apps."

Applications in the App Engine flexible environment currently use a Debian 8 ""Jessie"" operating system. The Debian 8 ""Jessie"" OS will lose full support from the Debian maintainers in June 2018. In advance of this change, Google will migrate customers to an Ubuntu-based OS starting on May 30, 2018. To update your application to the Ubuntu 16.04 OS, re-deploy your application after May 30, 2018.
If for some reason you need to opt-out of this automatic upgrade, you can pin your application to the old Debian 8 ""Jessie"" OS.

Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:

Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests, which are the first request to a new instance.
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic. The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.
For more details, see the auto scaling documentation.

Feature

Added beta support for version 1.9 of the Go runtime.
You can try out Go 1.9 by specifying api_version: go1.9 in your app.yaml configuration file.
To use the 1.9 beta version, you must first update your Go SDK to 1.9.63 or later. For details about downloading and installing the SDK, see the Downloads page.
During the beta period, api_version: go1 continues to be an alias for go1.8. Note that go1.9 is not guaranteed to work correctly while it is in beta. We are relying on user feedback to ensure that go1.9 meets users' needs before promoting it to a GA release. Post feedback to the google-appengine-go Google Group.

App Engine is changing the URLs that you use to send requests to your apps. You can now include a region ID to help Google route your requests more efficiently and reliably.

To ensure a smooth transition, we are slowly updating App Engine to use region IDs.

Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:

Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests, which are the first request to a new instance.
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic. The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.
For more details, see the auto scaling documentation.

App Engine is changing the URLs that you use to send requests to your apps. You can now include a region ID to help Google route your requests more efficiently and reliably. For example, an app can receive requests at https://<var>PROJECT_ID</var>.<var>REGION_ID</var>.r.appspot.com. This new URL is optional for existing apps, and will soon be required for all new apps.
To ensure a smooth transition, we are slowly updating App Engine to use region IDs. If we haven't updated your Google Cloud project yet, you won't see a region ID for your app. Since the ID is optional for existing apps, you don't need to update URLs or make other changes once the region ID is available for your existing apps.

Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:

Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests, which are the first request to a new instance.
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic. The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.

Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:

Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests, which are the first request to a new instance.
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic. The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.
For more details, see the auto scaling documentation.

When committing a cross-group transaction, version numbers returned for new or updated entities are all the same. With the previous behavior, entities within the same group committed as part of a cross-group transaction, had the same version number, but entities in different groups might have had different version numbers. This change ensures all new and updated entities have an identical version number, regardless of their entity group, when committed as part of a cross-group transaction.

RHEL 6.x systems using kernel versions 2.6.32-xxx and using LVM may reach a kernel panic when booting in Compute Engine during migration.
Workaround: The kernel should be upgraded to 2.6.32-754 or higher before migrating.
Issue
#143262721: Migration of VM from Azure fails when data disk is greater than 4 terabytes.
At this time, Migrate for Compute Engine does not support migration of Azure VMs with data disks bigger than 4TB.
Workaround: Make sure VM has data disk smaller than 4TB.
Issue
#131532690: Run-in-cloud and migration operations may fail for Windows Server 2016 workload when Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is installed. This may also happen when SEP appears to be disabled.
Workaround: Modify workload Network interface bindings to remove the SEP option.Download Microsoft Network VSP Bind (nvspbind)  Install Microsoft_Nvspbind_package.EXE into c:\temp. Open a command prompt as an Administrator and run the following: nvspbind.exe /d * symc_teefer2
Issue
#131614405: When the Velostrata Prep RPM is installed on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, the VM obtains a DHCP IP address in addition to an existing static IP configuration. This issue occurs when the VM is started on-premises in a subnet that is enabled with DHCP services.
Note: The issue does not occur when the subnet has no DHCP services. There is no connectivity impact for communications with the original static IP address.
Issue
#131637800: After registering the Velostrata plug-in, running the Cloud Extension wizard might generate an error ""XXXXXXXXXX"" upon ""Finish"".
Workaround: Un-register the Velostrata plug-in and restart the vSphere Web client service, then re-register the plug-in. Contact support if the issue persists.
Issue
#131548730: In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
Workaround: Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
Issue
#131605387: vCenter reboot causes Velostrata tasks in vCenter to disappear from UI. This is a vCenter limitation.
Workaround: Use the Velostrata PowerShell module to monitor Velostrata managed VMs or Cloud Extensions tasks that are currently running.

Ingress access logging is now a configurable feature called logging in versions 1.16.8-gke.10 and later. This allows Ingress access logging to be toggled on or off through the BackendConfig resource.
ChangesDeprecated
HTTP access logging for newly created Ingress resources is being deprecated across various GKE versions on May 12th, 2020. Any new Ingress resources created with the following versions after May 12th will have access logging disabled for that Ingress resource and will not record Ingress HTTP requests in Cloud Logging. Note that existing Ingress resources will continue to log HTTP requests unless the Ingress resource is redeployed. The following GKE versions are affected:
1.12
1.13
1.14 clusters less than 1.14.10-gke.30
1.15 clusters less than 1.15.9-gke.22
1.16 clusters less than 1.16.6-gke.12
Clusters whose masters are on 1.14.10-gke.30, 1.15.9-gke.22, 1.16.6-gke.12 or later versions are not impacted and HTTP access logging remains defaulted to ""on"" for all new and existing Ingress resources. If you're currently using access logging for GKE Ingress, we highly recommend upgrading to these versions or higher before May 12th to avoid loss of HTTP access logs for new Ingress resources.
In GKE 1.18, access logging will be changed to default to ""off"" for the GKE Ingress. Enabling access logging through the logging parameter is required to enable it for Ingress resources.

Known issuesDue to the recent Windows Server security update provided by Microsoft in February 2020, a container incompatibility issue was introduced. To avoid disruption to your workloads, we have turned off Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) auto-upgrade for the impacted clusters.What do I need to know?As a consequence of Microsoft's security update, your workloads may end up in a failed state due to broken compatibility if the host Windows Server image has the security update and the container base image does not have the update.We have turned off auto-upgrade on the impacted GKE clusters to prevent this compatibility issue from affecting your workloads.The security update will be available in the rapid channel in GKE starting April 6, 2020. Beginning April 20, 2020, Windows Server container support in GKE, along with the security update will be available on the regular channel.What do I need to do?We strongly recommend you to rebuild your container images with the base Windows images that include Windows Updates from March 2020, then manually upgrade your node pool to the latest GKE version. Please follow the following steps:Disable auto-upgrade on the Windows node pool(s). When the first step is complete, Google will restart the cluster auto-upgrade. Please note that this could take a few days. The cluster's master and the Linux node pool(s) will be upgraded. The Windows node pool will not get upgraded as auto-upgrade is disabled in step number one. After the cluster master upgrade is complete and you have rebuilt your container images, manually upgrade your Windows node pool. After completing step number three, you can turn back on the auto-upgrade option. If you choose to turn the auto-upgrade option back on, please use multi-arch (or multi-platform) images to take advantage of the auto-upgrade feature.Incompatibility issues such as this one are a rare occurrence as it is against Microsoft's typical guidance for the security updates. Rest assured that if such issues occur again, we will keep you posted. Please stay up to date with GKE's release notes for the latest info.If you have any questions or require assistance, please email us or contact Google Cloud Support."

Versions no longer availableThe following versions are no longer available for new clusters or upgrades.1.12.10-gke.17
1.12.10-gke.20
1.12.10-gke.22New featuresFeature
You can now use Customer-managed encryption keys (beta) to control the encryption used for node boot disks as well as attached persistent disks in your clusters.
Feature
Consuming reservations in GKE is now generally available. Reservations allow you to reserve resources in a specific zone to ensure sufficient capacity is available for your workloads.
ChangesChanged
New clusters and node-pools created with the GKE API will have node auto-upgrade enabled by default. This change ensures that your clusters have the most recent default Kubernetes version, bug fixes, and security patches. Existing scripts running against the gcloud CLI or integrating with the GKE API will follow this new default behavior.
Node autoupgrades keep the nodes in your cluster up to date with the cluster master version when your master is updated on your behalf. To disable it explicitly, set autoUpgrade to false in the NodeManagement object."

Rollouts begin on the day of the note and take four or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. For more information, see the Rollout schedule.New versions available for upgrades and new clustersThe following Kubernetes versions are now available for new clusters and for opt-in master upgrades and node upgrades for existing clusters. See these instructions for more information on the Kubernetes versioning scheme.
No Channelv.1.12.x
1.12.10-gke.22
v.1.15.x
1.15.4-gke.22

GKE 1.15 is generally available for new clusters.

Upgrading
Before creating GKE v1.15 clusters, you must review the known issues and urgent upgrade notes.
New features

By default, firewall rules restrict your cluster master to only initiate TCP connections to your nodes on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 10250 (kubelet). For some Kubernetes features, you might need to add firewall rules to allow access on additional ports. For example, in Kubernetes 1.9 and older, kubectl top accesses heapster, which needs a firewall rule to allow TCP connections on port 8080. To grant such access, you can add firewall rules.


Node-local DNS caching is now available in beta. This does create a single point of failure. If the node-cache goes down DNS for all Pods on that node will be broken until the cache is up.

Known Issues

There is a low risk that consumers of the published OpenAPI document that made assumptions about the absence of schema info for a given type (for example, ""no schema info means a resource is a custom resource"") could have those assumptions broken once custom resources start publishing schema definitions.

You are reading files with the content-encoding set to gzip, and the files are dynamically decompressive transcoded by Cloud Storage.
The file size (decompressed) is larger than 2.14 GB.
The input stream runs into an error (and is recreated) after 2.14 GB is read.

Issue

TD-39411: Cannot import BigQuery table or view when source is originally from Google Suite.

Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA only supports native BigQuery tables and views. Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA does not support BigQuery sources that reference data stored in Google Suite, such as Google Sheets.
Workaround: Create a copy of the BigQuery table linked to the Google Suite source within BigQuery. Then, import the native BigQuery table as a dataset in Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA using the Import Dataset page.

TD-39386: Some users may not be able to edit datasets with parameters, receiving an HTTP 403 error (permission denied) on sources that should be accessible.

Workaround: Create a replacement dataset with parameters from scratch and swap out the old dataset with the new dataset with parameters.

TD-39296: Cannot run Cloud Dataflow jobs on datasets with parameters sourced from Parquet file or files.

Workaround: Generate source using another supported file format or union all Parquet-sourced datasets as first step.

TD-39295: Parquet jobs fail on Cloud Dataflow when dataset contains columns of INT96 data type.

Workaround: Data type INT96 has been deprecated from the library used to convert Parquet data. Please change the source to another data type and re-import. For more information, see PARQUET-1480 on GitHub.

TD-39173: Cannot preview imported datasets when source is Avro file.

Workaround: File can still be imported and wrangled.

TD-38869: Upload of Parquet files does not support nested values, which appear as null values in the Transformer page.

Workaround: Unnest the values before importing into the platform.

TD-37688: Documentation for new Selection Details Panel was not updated.

The Selection Details panel replaces and extends the Suggestion Cards Panel. The feature is present, while the documentation is outdated.
Updated documentation will be available in the next release.
Workaround: Documentation for the new Selection Details panel is available here: Selection Details Panel.

TD-37683: Send a copy does not create independent sets of recipes and datasets in new flow. If imported datasets are removed in the source flow, they disappear from the sent version.

Workaround: Create new versions of the imported datasets in the sent flow.


Fixed

TD-36332: Data grid can display wrong results if a sample is collected and dataset is unioned.
TD-36192: Canceling a step in recipe panel can result in column menus disappearing in the data grid.
TD-31252: Assigning a target schema through the Column Browser does not refresh the page.
DP-98: BigQuery does not support reading from tables stored in regions other than US or EU.

NOTE: Support for NUMERIC data type for BigQuery began on August 20, 2018. For details, see BigQuery Release Notes.
Support for NUMERIC data type in is planned for a future release.

TD-34061: Running jobs on datasets sourced from more than 6000 files may fail.
NOTE: Due to a limitation in Cloud Dataflow, when you run a job on a parameterized dataset containing more than 1000 files, the input paths data must be compressed, which results in non-readable location values in the Cloud Dataflow job details.
Workaround: For this and other performance reasons, try to limit your parameterized datasets to no more than 5000 source files.
TD-33428: Job execution on recipe with high limit in split transformation due to Java Null Pointer Error during profiling.
NOTE: Avoid creating datasets that are wider than 2500 columns. Performance can degrade significantly on very wide datasets.

Breaking
Breaking Changes:

Dataproc will no longer accept requests to create new clusters using Debian 8 images. Existing clusters that are using Debian 8 can still be used and scaled.
The alpha version of the Kerberos optional component option has been removed from the v1beta2 API. To use Kerberos, please configure it via the SecurityConfig message instead.
Disallow setting or overriding goog-dataproc-* labels when creating or updating clusters. All attempts to set goog-dataproc-* labels on creation will be ignored. Any existing custom goog-dataproc-* labels on running clusters will be removed if cluster labels are updated, and attempts to add new custom goog-dataproc-* labels to existing clusters will be ignored.
Reset autoscaling if the same or a new autoscaling policy is attached to a cluster. E.g. through gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<policy-name>. Note that resetting autoscaling does not change the cluster's status. Autoscaling will only run while the cluster's status is RUNNING or UPDATING, and does not work if the cluster is in ERROR. In addition, if the cluster was previously resizing (UPDATING), the autoscaler will not be able to scale the cluster until the previous update operation has completed.

Also fixes an issue where autoscaling would not reset correctly if autoscaling was disabled then re-enabled with the same within 30 seconds. Running gcloud dataproc clusters update --disable-autoscaling and then gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<same-policy> should now correctly reset autoscaling regardless of how long autoscaling was disabled.


Fixed

Fixed race condition where deleting a cluster shortly after updating it would not delete all of the cluster's VMs
Allow compute resource names with an Alpha API version. For example: https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/alpha/projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network.

This allows gcloud alpha dataproc clusters create <cluster-name> --network=my-network to succeed, since gcloud sets the compute API version to the same as the gcloud command track.

Initial release of Cloud Datastore API v1beta3.
Changes to the API definition:

The API is now defined in three proto files: entity.proto, query.proto, and datastore.proto.
The proto files now use proto3 syntax:

Maps are used for several fields (see below for details).
All enums add a value with suffix _UNSPECIFIED that is equal to 0.
oneof is used to prevent setting mutually-exclusive fields:

Fields id and name in message PathElement.
The value fields in message Value.
Fields composite_filter and property_filter in type Filter.
Fields value and cursor in message GqlQueryParameter.
Fields upsert, update, upsert, and delete in message Mutation.


All request messages add a top-level field project_id. This field is populated automatically for requests made over HTTP.
Several repeated fields now have plural names:

In message CompositeFilter, filter is now filters.
In message QueryResultBatch, entity_result is now entity_results.
In message LookupRequest, key is now keys.
In message AllocateIdsRequest, key is now keys.
In message AllocateIdsResponse, key is now keys.

The proto package name now includes the API version.
In message PartitionId:

Field dataset_id is now project_id. project_id never includes the app/project ID ""prefix"" (e.g. ""s~""). This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/59.
Field namespace is now namespace_id.

In message Key, field path_element is now path.
In message Value:

Null values are represented by explicitly setting field null_value with type com.protobuf.NullValue. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.
Field timestamp_microseconds_value is now timestamp_value with type google.protobuf.Timestamp. In JSON, the field dateTimeValue is now timestampValue. This field is still limited to microsecond precision.
Field blob_key_value is removed. Values that previously populated that field in the v1beta1 or v1beta2 APIs will instead populate field string_value in the v1beta3 API.
Field geo_point_value of type google.type.LatLng is added.
Repeated field list_value is replaced with array_value of type ArrayValue.
Field indexed, which defaulted to true, is now exclude_from_indexes, which defaults to false.

Message Property is removed. In message Entity, repeated field property is now field properties which is a map from string to Value.
Message PropertyExpression is now Projection.
Message EntityResult adds a field cursor of type bytes.
In message Query:

Field group_by is now distinct_on.
Field limit is now of type google.protobuf.Int32Value.

In message PropertyExpression, enum AggregationFunction and field aggregation_function are removed.
In messages CompositeFilter and PropertyFilter, field operator is now op.
In message GqlQuery:

Field allow_literal is now allow_literals.
Repeated field name_arg is now map field named_bindings.
Field number_arg is now positional_bindings.

Message GqlQueryArg is now GqlQueryParameter. Field name is removed.
Enum MoreResultsType adds a new value MORE_RESULTS_AFTER_CURSOR.
Message QueryResultBatch adds field skipped_cursor.
In message Mutation:

A Mutation now describes one change to one single entity. Its fields are no longer repeated.
Field insert_auto_id is removed. insert and update mutations now support auto ID allocation.
Field force is removed.

In message MutationResult:

Field index_updates is moved to message CommitResponse.
Repeated field insert_auto_id_key is now key and is no longer repeated.

Message RunQueryResponse adds field query. When a RunQueryRequest message sets field gql_query, the RunQueryResponse message sets field query to the parsed form of the GqlQuery message from the request.
In message BeginTransactionRequest, enum IsolationLevel and field isolation_level are removed. All transactions are now serializable.
In message CommitRequest, field mutation is now repeated field mutations.
In message CommitResponse, field mutation_result is now repeated field mutation_results.

Changes to the JSON API:

Null values are now supported. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.
Fields set to their default values are not included in responses, for example:

Fields found, missing, and deferred in message to LookupResponse are not included when they are empty.
Field entity_result in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is empty.
Field skipped_results in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is 0.


The API endpoint format has changed. For example, in v1beta2, a RunQuery is sent to: https://www.googleapis.com/datastore/v1beta2/datasets/<dataset-id>/runQuery
In v1beta3, it is sent to:
https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1beta3/projects/<project-id>:runQuery
Account domain restrictions no longer apply when accessing the API. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.
Errors:

JSON errors add a status field and remove the errors list.
Errors resulting from requests with a content type of application/x-protobuf are now a serialized google.rpc.Status message.

Changes to GQL:

In synthetic literal KEY, DATASET is now PROJECT.
The BLOBKEY synthetic literal is removed.
The FIRST aggregator is removed.
The GROUP BY clause is replaced with DISTINCT ON.
Fully-qualified property names are now supported.
Query filters on timestamps prior to the epoch are now supported.

Empty array values are now supported.
Indexing and querying properties inside of entity values is now supported. Values inside entity values are indexed by default.
Key normalization:

In Key objects in RunQueryRequests, key normalization will never set partition_id.namespace_id, as it previously did under some circumstances. If a key should reference that partition its partition_id.namespace_id must be explicitly set.
Key objects with empty path and empty or unset partition_id are no longer normalized.

Writes of foreign partition IDs may now fail if the foreign project is not in an active state. For this reason, use of foreign partition IDs is discouraged.
In a non-transactional Commit requests, no two mutations may affect the same entity.
In transactional Commit requests, mutations affecting the same entity are applied in the order in which they appear in the request. Certain sequences of mutations affecting the same entity are not permitted.
Field more_results in message QueryResultBatch is accurate in more cases. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/48.
The typical number of results returned by a call to RunQuery is smaller due to a change in server-side batching. As before, clients should not rely on the batch size and instead use cursors to continue queries.
Scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email is no longer required.
The API works for projects that have an App Engine domain restriction. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.
gcd tool:

Options -d, --dataset_id, and --dataset_id_override are now -p, --project_id, and --project_id_override, respectively.
Option --auth_mode is removed. The updateindexes and vacuumindexes commands always use OAuth 2.0.
Option --auto_generate_indexes is now --store_index_configuration_on_disk.
Index configuration for new projects is now stored in a YAML file: <directory>/WEB-INF/index.yaml. Index configuration for projects that previously used XML will continue to do so.

Anthos GKE on-prem 1.3.0-gke.16 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem. 
GKE on-prem 1.3.0-gke.16 clusters run on Kubernetes 1.15.7-gke.32.
Feature
A new installer helps you create and prepare the admin workstation.
Feature
Support for vSAN datastore on your admin and user clusters.
Feature
In bundled load balancing mode, GKE on-prem provides and manages the Seesaw load balancer.
Feature
The Authentication Plugin for Anthos has been integrated into and replaced with the Google Cloud command-line interface, which improves the authentication process and provides the user consent flow through gcloud commands.
Feature
Added support for up to 100 nodes per user cluster. 
Feature
The Cluster CA now signs the TLS certificates that the Kubelet API serves, and the TLS certificates are auto-rotated.
Feature
vSphere credential rotation is enabled. Users can now use Solution User Certificates to authenticate to GKE deployed on-prem.
Feature
gkectl automatically uses the proxy URL from config.yaml to configure the proxy on the admin workstation.
Feature
Preview Feature: Introducing User cluster Nodepools. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. In GKE on-prem 1.3.0, node pools are a preview feature in the user clusters. This feature lets users create multiple node pools in a cluster, and update them as needed.
Changed
The metric kubelet_containers_per_pod_count is changed to a histogram metric.
Fixed
Fixed an issue in the vSphere storage plugin that prevented vSphere storage policies from working.  This is an example of how you might use this feature.
Issue
Prometheus + Grafana: two graphs on the Machine dashboard don't work because of missing metrics: Disk Usage and Disk Available.
Issue
All OOM events for containers trigger a SystemOOM event, even if they are container/pod OOM events. To check whether an OOM is actually a SystemOOM, check the kernel log for a message oom-kill:…. If oom_memcg=/ (instead of oom_memcg=/kubepods/…), then it's a SystemOOM.  If it's not a SystemOOM, it's safe to ignore.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.3.0-gke.16
If you configured a proxy in the config.yaml and also used a bundle other than the full bundle
  (static IP |
  DHCP), you must append the --fast flag to run gkectl check-config. For example: gkectl check-config --config config.yaml --fast.
Issue
Running the 1.3 version of the gkectl diagnose command might fail if your clusters:

Are older than Anthos GKE on-prem version 1.3.
Include manually installed add-ons in the kube-system namespace.

GKE on-prem version 1.2.1-gke.4 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem.
This patch version includes the following changes:
Feature
Adds searchdomainsfordns field to static IPs host configuration file. searchdomainsfordns is an array of DNS search domains to use in the cluster. These domains are used as part of a domain search list.

Feature
Adds a --cleanup flag for gkectl check-config. The flag's default value is true.
Passing in --cleanup=false preserves the test VM and associated SSH keys that gkectl check-config creates for its preflight checks. Preserving the VM can be helpful for debugging.
Fixed
Fixes a known issue from 1.2.0-gke.6 that prevented gkectl check-config from performing all of its validations against clusters in nested resource pools or the default resource pool.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that caused F5 BIG-IP VIP validation to fail due to timing out. The timeout window for F5 BIG-IP VIP validation is now longer.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that caused cluster upgrades to overwrite changes to add-on configurations.
Fixed
Fixes the known issue from 1.2.0-gke.6 that affects routing updates due to the route reflector configuration."
1483,Anthos GKE,https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/release-notes,https://cloud.google.com/feeds/gkeonprem-release-notes.xml,"January 28, 2020",Issue,"Issue
Affected versions: 1.2.0-gke.6
In some cases, certain nodes in a user cluster fail to get routing updates from the route reflector. Consequently Pods on a node may not be able to communicate with Pods on other nodes. One possible symptom is a kube-dns resolution error.
To work around this issue, follow these steps to create a BGPPeer object in your user cluster.
Save the following BGPPeer manifest as full-mesh.yaml:
apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: full-mesh
spec:
  nodeSelector: ""!has(route-reflector)""
  peerSelector: ""!has(route-reflector)"" 

Create the BGPPeer in your user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] apply -f full-mesh.yaml
Verify that the full-mesh BGPPeer was created:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] get bgppeer
The output shows full-mesh in the list of BGPPeers:
NAME            AGE
  full-mesh       61s
  gke-group-1     3d21h
  ...

This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.1."

Affected versions: 1.1.0-gke.6 and later
Starting with version 1.1.0-gke.6, the gkeconnect.proxy field is no longer in the GKE on-prem configuration file.
If you include gkeconnect.proxy in the configuration file, the gkectl check-config command can fail with this error:
[FAILURE] Config: Could not parse config file: error unmarshaling JSON: 
while decoding JSON: json: unknown field ""proxy""

To correct this issue, remove gkeconnect.proxy from the configuration file.

Warning: If you installed GKE on-prem versions before 1.2, and you use a vSAN datastore, you should contact Google Support before attempting an upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6.
GKE on-prem version 1.2.0-gke.6 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem.
This minor version includes the following changes:
Feature
The default Kubernetes version for cluster nodes is now version 1.14.7-gke.24 (previously 1.13.7-gke.20).
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports vSphere 6.7 Update 3. Read its release notes.
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports VMware NSX-T version 2.4.2.
Feature
Any user cluster, even your first use cluster, can now use a datastore that is separate from the admin cluster's datastore. If you specify a separate datastore for a user cluster, the user cluster nodes, PersistentVolumes (PVs) for the user cluster nodes, user control plane VMs, and PVs for the user control plane VMs all use the separate datastore.
Feature
Expanded preflight checks for validating your GKE on-prem configuration file before your create your clusters. These new checks can validate that your Google Cloud project, vSphere network, and other elements of your environment are correctly configured.
Feature
Published basic installation workflow. This workflow offers a simplified workflow for quickly installing GKE on-prem using static IPs.
Feature
Published guidelines for installing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. CSI enables using storage devices not natively supported by Kubernetes.
Feature
Updated documentation for authenticating using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with the Anthos Plugin for Kubectl. GKE on-prem's OIDC integration is now generally available.
Changed
From the admin workstation, gcloud now requires that you log in to gcloud with a Google Cloud user account. The user account should have at least the Viewer Cloud IAM role in all Google Cloud projects associated with your clusters.
Changed
You can now create admin and user clusters separately from one another.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that prevented resuming cluster creation for HA user clusters.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.1.0-gke.6, 1.2.0-gke.6
The stackdriver.proxyconfigsecretname field was removed in version 1.1.0-gke.6. GKE on-prem's preflight checks will return an error if the field is present in your configuration file.
To work around this, before you install or upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6, delete the proxyconfigsecretname field from your configuration file.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.2.0-6-gke.6
In user clusters, Prometheus and Grafana get automatically disabled during upgrade. However, the configuration and metrics data are not lost. In admin clusters, Prometheus and Grafana stay enabled.
To work around this issue, after the upgrade, open monitoring-sample for editing and set enablePrometheus to true:
1.kubectl edit monitoring --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] \ -n kube-system monitoring-sample
2.
Set the field enablePrometheus to true.
Issue
Affected versions: All versions
Before version 1.2.0-gke.6, a known issue prevents Stackdriver from updating its configuration after cluster upgrades. Stackdriver still references an old version, which prevents Stackdriver from receiving the latest features of its telemetry pipeline. This issue can make it difficult for Google Support to troubleshoot clusters.
After you upgrade clusters to 1.2.0-gke.6, run the following command against admin and user clusters:
kubectl --kubeconfig=[KUBECONFIG] \
-n kube-system --type=json patch stackdrivers stackdriver \
-p '[{""op"":""remove"",""path"":""/spec/version""}]'

where [KUBECONFIG] is the path to the cluster's kubeconfig file."

GKE On-Prem's configuration file has a field, vcenter.datadisk, which looks for a path to a virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. During installation, you choose a name for the VMDK. By default, GKE On-Prem creates a VMDK and saves it to the root of your vSphere datastore.
If you are using a vSAN datastore, you need to create a folder in the datastore in which to save the VMDK. You provide the full path to the field—for example, datadisk: gke-on-prem/datadisk.vmdk—and GKE On-Prem saves the VMDK in that folder.
When you create the folder, vSphere assigns the folder a universally unique identifier (UUID). Although you provide the folder path to the GKE On-Prem config, the vSphere API looks for the folder's UUID. Currently, this mismatch can cause cluster creation and upgrades to fail.
A fix is targeted for version 1.1.2. In the meantime, you need to provide the folder's UUID instead of the folder's path. Follow the workaround instructions currently available in the upgrading clusters and installation topics."

Issue
Known Issues
Issue
For user clusters that are using static IPs and a different network than their admin cluster: If you overwrite the user cluster's network configuration, the user control plane might not be able to start. This occurs because it's using the user cluster's network, but allocates an IP address and gateway from the admin cluster.
As a workaround, you can update each user control plane's MachineDeployment specification to use the correct network. Then, delete each user control plane Machine, causing the MachineDeployment to create new Machines:

List MachineDeployments in the admin cluster
kubectl get machinedeployments --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

Update a user control plane MachineDeployment from your shell
kubectl edit machinedeployment --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] [MACHINEDEPLOYMENT_NAME]

List Machines in the admin cluster

GKE On-Prem version 1.1.0-gke.6 is now available. To download version 1.1.0-gke.6's gkectl and upgrade bundle, see Downloads. Then, see Upgrading clusters.
This minor version includes the following changes:
Feature
The default Kubernetes version for cluster nodes is now version 1.13.7-gke.20 (previously 1.12.7-gke.19).
Feature
Action required: As of version 1.1.0-gke.6, GKE On-Prem now creates vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) rules for your user cluster's nodes (vSphere VMs), causing them to be spread across at least three physical hosts in your datacenter.
This feature is enabled by default for all new and existing user clusters running version 1.1.0-gke.6.
The feature requires that your vSphere environment meets the following conditions:

VMware DRS must be enabled. VMware DRS requires vSphere Enterprise Plus license edition. To learn how to enable DRS, see Enabling VMware DRS in a cluster.
The vSphere user account provided in your GKE On-Prem configuration file's vcenter field must have the Host.Inventory.EditCluster permission.
There are at least three physical hosts available.

If you do not want to enable this feature for your existing user clusters—for example, if you don't have enough hosts to accommdate the feature—perform the following steps before you upgrade your user clusters:

Open your existing GKE On-Prem configuration file.
Under the usercluster specification, add the antiaffinitygroups field as described in the antiaffinitygroups documentation:
usercluster:
          ...
          antiaffinitygroups:
            enabled: false
Save the file.
Use the configuration file to upgrade. Your clusters are upgraded, but the feature is not enabled.

Feature
You can now set the default storage class for your clusters.
Feature
You can now use Container Storage Interface (CSI) 1.0 as a storage class for your clusters.
Feature
You can now delete broken or unhealthy user clusters with gkectl delete cluster --force
Feature
You can now diagnose node issues using the debug-toolbox container image.
Feature
You can now skip validatations run by gkectl commands.

GKE On-Prem is now generally available. Version 1.0.10 includes the following changes:
Changed
Upgrading from beta-1.4 to 1.0.10
Before upgrading your beta clusters to the first general availability version, perform the steps described in Upgrading from GKE On-Prem beta to general availability, and review the following points:

If you are running a beta version before beta-1.4, be sure to upgrade to beta-1.4 first.
If your beta clusters are running their own L4 load balancers (not the default, F5 BIG-IP), you need to delete and recreate your clusters to run the latest GKE On-Prem version.
If your clusters were upgraded to beta-1.4 from beta-1.3, run the following command for each user cluster before upgrading:
kubectl delete crd networkpolicies.crd.projectcalico.org
vCenter certificate verification is now required. (vsphereinsecure is no longer supported.) If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.
You need to upgrade all of your running clusters. For this upgrade to succeed, your clusters can't run in a mixed version state.
You need to upgrade your admin clusters to the latest version first, then upgrade your user clusters.

Feature
New Features
Feature
You can now enable the Manual load balancing mode to configure a L4 load balancer. You can still choose to use the default load balancer, F5 BIG-IP.
Feature
GKE On-Prem's configuration-driven installation process has been updated. You now declaratively install using a singular configuration file.
Feature
Adds gkectl create-config, which generates a configuration file for installing GKE On-Prem, upgrading existing clusters, and for creating additional user clusters in an existing installation. This replaces the installation wizard and create-config.yaml from previous versions. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.
Feature
Adds gkectl check-config, which validates the GKE On-Prem configuration file. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.
Feature
Adds an optional --validate-attestations flag to gkectl prepare. This flag verifies that the container images included in your admin workstationwere built and signed by Google and are ready for deployment. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.

vCenter certificate verification is now required. vsphereinsecure is no longer supported). You provide the certificate in the GKE On-Prem configration file's cacertpath field.
When a client calls the vCenter server, the vCenter server must prove its identity to the client by presenting a certificate. That certificate must be signed by a certificate authority (CA). The certificate is must not be self-signed.
If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.

On May 8, 2019, we introduced a change to Connect, the service that enables you to interact with your GKE On-Prem clusters using Cloud Console. To use the new Connect agent, you must re-register your clusters with Cloud Console, or you must upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
Your GKE On-Prem clusters and the workloads running on them will continue to operate uninterrupted. However, your clusters will not be visible in Cloud Console until you re-register them or upgrade to beta-1.4.
Before you re-register or upgrade, make sure your service account has the gkehub.connect role. Also, if your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, it's a good idea to remove that role.
Grant your service account the gkehub.connect role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \n      --member=""serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \n      --role=""roles/gkehub.connect""

Issue
Clusters upgraded from version beta-1.2 to beta-1.3 might be affected by a known issue that damages the cluster's configuration file and prevents future cluster upgrades. This issue affects all future cluster upgrades.
You can resolve this issue by deleting and recreating clusters upgraded from beta-1.2 to beta-1.3.
To resolve the issue without deleting and recreating the cluster, you need to re-encode and apply each cluster's Secrets. Perform the following steps:

Get the contents of the create-config Secrets stored in the admin cluster. This must be done for the create-config Secret in the kube-system namespace, and for thecreate-config Secrets in each user cluster's namespace:
kubectl get secret create-config -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > kube-system_create_secret.yaml
kubectl get secret create-config -n [USER_CLUSTER_NAME] -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml
For each user cluster, open the <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml file in an editor. If the values for registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey are not REDACTED, no further action is required: the Secrets do not need to be re-encoded and written to the cluster.
Open the original create_config.yaml file in another editor.
In <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml, replace the registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey values with the values from the original create_config.yaml file. Save the changed file.
Repeat steps 3-5 for each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml, and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file.
Base64-encode each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml file and the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file:
cat [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml | base64 > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret_create_secret.b64
cat kube-system-cluster_create_secret.yaml | base64 >kube-system-cluster_create_secret.b64
Replace the data[cfg] field in each Secret in the cluster with the contents of the corresponding file:
kubectl edit secret create-config -n [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]

  # kubectl edit opens the file in the shell's default text editor
  # Open `first-user-cluster_create_secret.b64` in another editor, and replace
  # the `cfg` value with the copied value
  # Make sure the copied string has no newlines in it!
Repeat step 8 for each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml Secret, and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml Secret.
To ensure that the update was successful, repeat step 1.

Repos now sync correctly even if it only contains configs for Namespaces.ChangesChangedThe git-policy-importer application has been renamed to git-importer.ChangedThe nomos-cluster-policy ClusterConfig has been renamed to config-management-cluster-config. After upgrading, both ClusterConfig objects both exist on the cluster. This does not impact the functionality of the cluster, but you may see spurious log messages if the older ClusterConfig is still present. You can remove the old ClusterConfig to avoid these log messages:

kubectl delete clusterconfig nomos-cluster-policy

Migrate for Anthos CSI drive would sometimes fail connecting to the migrated VM.
Fixed

1573,Migrate for Anthos,https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos/docs/release-notes,https://cloud.google.com/feeds/migrateanthos-release-notes.xml,"November 13, 2019",Feature,"v1.0.0
Feature
Migrate for Anthos supports migrating existing VMware, Amazon EC2, Azure, and Compute Engine VMs to containers on Google Kubernetes Engine. For more information, see Benefits of Migrate for Anthos.
Feature
You can monitor export of short-term storage to a persistent volume using kubectl. For more information, see Exporting streaming PVs to permanent storage.
Feature
Using a ConfigMap, you can have content from application log files you specify written to Stackdriver Logging (a default list is included). For more, see Configuring logging to Stackdriver Logging.
Feature
For information on operating systems supported by Migrate for Anthos, see Compatible VM operating systems.
Issue
On the Migrate for Compute Engine portlet in VMWare vCenter, VMs will be shown as Managed by Migrate for Compute Engine during migration process. Only the cache and storage migration status are updated in this view. Other functionality, such as Migrate for Compute Engine actions, may not be functional.
Issue
For known issues and workarounds, see Troubleshooting Migrate for Anthos.
Issue
VMs using EFI configurations are not compatible for migration with this release.
Issue
Operating systems running systemd versions lower than 234 are limited to 65536 open files.
Issue
When using a private GKE cluster, the GKE master might be unable to reach Migrate for Anthos infrastructure (specifically, the admission-controller) by default. This is because the admission-controller pod listens on port 7000.
To work around this issue, add port 7000 to the firewall rules of the master node. For more, see Creating a private cluster.
Issue
When specifying a mixed-case value for the clone_vm_disks script's -A <var>app-name</var> argument, the YAML file generated by the script includes a workload name that can not be deployed.
To work around this issue, specify the argument's value in lowercase only.
Issue
The Migrate for Compute Engine password can be inadvertently logged in Stackdriver Logging.
Issue
Migrate for Anthos fails to recognize a reference to a disk specified as a PARTUUID in the fstab file.
Issue
Deleting a StatefulSet attached to a persistent volume will leave the volume in an attached state.
Issue
Using configuration YAML from a version prior to 1.0 causes the pod to enter a crashloop stage.
To work around this, update your YAML file to conform to the latest definition.
Issue
When resolving block devices in a multipath device, the operation appears to succeed even if there was an error with one of the block devices.
Issue
Resolving source storage devices would sometimes fail without error if one of the devices has no partitions.
Issue
Using kubectl exec on a migration pod sometimes displays superfluous bash warnings about LC_ALL. These are only cosmetic.
Issue
Attempting to switch to a non-root user with the su command after connecting to the machine with ssh fails when you have previously used su to switch to another user.
To work around this issue, use kubectl exec instead of ssh to get a shell to the container.
Issue
Migrate for Anthos CSI drive may sometimes fail connecting to the migrated VM.
Issue

#143313211: Customer migrating RHEL 6.8 VM may experience boot issues in the cloud destination.
RHEL 6.x systems using kernel versions 2.6.32-xxx and using LVM may reach a kernel panic when booting in Compute Engine during migration.
Workaround: The kernel should be upgraded to 2.6.32-754 or higher before migrating.
Issue
#143262721: Migration of VM from Azure fails when data disk is greater than 4 terabytes.
At this time, Migrate for Compute Engine does not support migration of Azure VMs with data disks bigger than 4TB.
Workaround: Make sure VM has data disk smaller than 4TB.
Issue
#131532690: Run-in-cloud and migration operations may fail for Windows Server 2016 workload when Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is installed. This may also happen when SEP appears to be disabled.
Workaround: Modify workload Network interface bindings to remove the SEP option.Download Microsoft Network VSP Bind (nvspbind)  Install Microsoft_Nvspbind_package.EXE into c:\temp. Open a command prompt as an Administrator and run the following: nvspbind.exe /d * symc_teefer2
Issue
#131614405: When the Velostrata Prep RPM is installed on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, the VM obtains a DHCP IP address in addition to an existing static IP configuration. This issue occurs when the VM is started on-premises in a subnet that is enabled with DHCP services.
Note: The issue does not occur when the subnet has no DHCP services. There is no connectivity impact for communications with the original static IP address.
Issue
#131637800: After registering the Velostrata plug-in, running the Cloud Extension wizard might generate an error ""XXXXXXXXXX"" upon ""Finish"".

Issue
#131548730: In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
Workaround: Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
Issue
#131605387: vCenter reboot causes Velostrata tasks in vCenter to disappear from UI. This is a vCenter limitation.
Workaround: Use the Velostrata PowerShell module to monitor Velostrata managed VMs or Cloud Extensions tasks that are currently running.
Issue
#131638716: With an ESXi host in maintenance mode, if a VM is moved to cloud, the operation will fail and get stuck in the rollback phase.

#131649978: In the event of certain system failures, Velostrata components disconnect from vCenter. In this case, an event may not be sent, resulting in the alarm either not being set properly or not being cleared properly.
Workaround: Clear the alarm manually in vCenter.
Issue
#131532549: For workloads with a Windows machine using a retail license, when returning from the cloud, the license is not present.
Workaround: Reinstall the license.
Issue
#131555885: vCenter ""Export OVA"" operation is available when the VM in cloud is running in cache mode, however, this operation results in a corrupted OVA.
Workaround: Only create OVA after the detach.
Issue
#131647857: In rare cases, when a cloud component instance is created and system fails before it is tagged, the instance will remain untagged. This will not allow full clean-up or repair of the CE.
Workaround: Manually tag the instance, and then run ""Repair"".

Issue
#131533480: When using the Create Cloud Extension wizard, using an illegal HTTP proxy address will not generate a warning message.
Workaround: Delete the CE and then create the CE with a valid HTTP proxy address.
Issue
#131647654: Run on-premises operation succeeded but the status is marked as failed with error ""Failed to consolidate snapshots""
Workaround: Consolidate snapshots via vCenter, and clear the error manually.

Workaround: Disable the affecting service while migrating and reinstall after Detach.
Issue
#131532882: In certain cases, initiating Run in Cloud during a Windows update may cause the update to terminate abruptly and cause a failure to boot in the cloud.
Workaround: Allow the system to finish Windows update and/or suspend Windows updates before migrating.
Issue
#135664281: When completing or canceling Azure to Google Cloud migration, if Velostrata Management failed to start the importer, Velostrata-created resources may be left in the original instance's resource group.
Issue
#133137658: Scenario: No network connection between Migration Manager and VSphere
Customer Impact: RunInCloud task will stay stuck due to failure in call to getReadSessions on VSphere.
Workaround: Fix the network connection. If not, cancel the task and try again.
Issue
#135573857 Scenario: When moving a VM back on-prem with ""force"" flag, failure to consolidate snapshot will cause the VM to remain as managed by Velostrata. RunInCloud on the same VM may fail since it is not allowed on managed VMs.
Workaround: Wait a couple of minutes and try again.
Issue
#137082702: In rare cases, the Cancel detach operation succeeds but the VM instance will fail to start.

Issue
App Engine is not supported by VPC Service Controls. However, you can use Access Context Manager to allow App Engine apps outside a service perimeter to access resources protected by VPC Service Controls by adding the App Engine service account to an access level for that perimeter.
For more information, read about App Engine limitations.
Issue
The BigQuery Data Transfer Service is not supported. Additionally, there are known limitations with the legacy BigQuery interface, the third-party ODBC driver for BigQuery, and BigQuery audit logs.
For more information, read about BigQuery limitations.
Issue
The Java and Python client libraries for all supported services are fully supported for access using the VPC Service Controls restricted VIP. Support for others language is at Alpha stage and should be used for testing purposes only. Client libraries updated since November 1, 2018 must be used.
Service account keys and OAuth2 client metadata used to authenticate must be updated as of November 1, 2018.
For more information, read about client library limitations.
Issue
To configure Cloud Billing exporting inside a service perimeter, the user performing the configuration must be added to an access level for that perimeter.
For more information, read about Cloud Billing limitations.
Issue
Cloud Dataproc requires additional steps to set up a functional cluster inside a service perimeter.
For more information, read about Cloud Dataproc limitations.
Issue
Cloud Functions is not supported by VPC Service Controls. However, you can use Access Context Manager to allow functions outside a service perimeter to access resources protected by VPC Service Controls by adding the Cloud Functions service account to an access level for that perimeter.
For more information, read about Cloud Functions limitations.
Issue
VPC Service Controls policy only applies to new Cloud Pub/Sub push subscriptions. Push subscriptions that exist before a service perimeter is created will not be blocked by that perimeter.
For more information, read about Cloud Pub/Sub limitations.
Issue
Cloud Shell is not supported. It is treated as outside of service perimeters and denied access to data protected by VPC Service Controls.
Issue
Legacy Cloud Storage buckets can in certain cases be written to out of a service perimeter even when access is denied.
Additionally, Cloud Storage audit logs do not always report VPC Service Controls errors correctly.
For more information, read about Cloud Storage limitations.
Issue
To create Compute Engine images from Cloud Storage inside a service perimeter, the user performing the configuration must be added to an access level for that perimeter.
For more information, read about Compute Engine limitations.
Issue
A Cloud DNS private zone or BIND must be used to map Container Registry to the restricted VIP.
The following Google-managed repositories are available to all projects regardless of service perimeters:

For more information, read about Container Registry limitations.
Issue
To use the Google Cloud Platform Console with services protected by a service perimeter, the user accessing the services must be added to an access level for that perimeter.
Issue
Because VPC Service Controls does not currently support folder and organization resources, log exports of folder-level and organization-level logs (including aggregate logs) do not support service perimeters.
Aggregated Stackdriver Logging logs can access data protected by a service perimeter. Cloud IAM should be used to control access to that data.

Cloud IAM policies now identify deleted members that are bound to a role. Deleted members have the prefix deleted: and the suffix ?uid=[NUMERIC_ID].
For example, if you delete the account for the user bob@example.com, and a policy binds that user to a role, the policy shows an identifier similar to deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901.
For SetIamPolicy requests, you can use this new syntax starting today. For GetIamPolicy and SetIamPolicy responses, because we are still rolling out this change, you might see the new prefix and suffix in some, but not all, responses. We expect to complete the rollout by December 13, 2019.
Issue
If a binding in a policy refers to a deleted member (for example, deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901), you cannot add a binding for a newly created member with the same name (in this case, user:bob@example.com). If you try to add a binding for the newly created member, Cloud IAM will apply the binding to the deleted member instead."

Welcome to the Cloud IAP general release for App Engine standard environment, Compute Engine, and GKE!
Issue
Cloud IAP for App Engine flexible environment is still in beta. This feature is not covered by any SLA or deprecation policy and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes for App Engine flexible environment.
Changed
Java code samples were updated with security enhancements on August 15, 2017. If you're using the Java signed headers code sample, please update your application per the current samples.
Changed
When you use the programmatic authentication feature, the aud claim in the JWT must now be the Cloud IAP client ID. Previously, it could also be the application URL. For applications that used programmatic authentication recently, we placed this feature on our whitelist. We will remove the functionality on November 15, 2017. For details and updated code samples, refer to programmatic authentication.
Changed
Due to internal security enhancements, App Engine standard environment apps no longer require login: required in app.yaml (or security-constraint for Java).
Feature
Forseti Security is now available and strongly encouraged for Compute Engine apps. If you have any questions or require assistance, please post to discuss@forsetisecurity.org.
