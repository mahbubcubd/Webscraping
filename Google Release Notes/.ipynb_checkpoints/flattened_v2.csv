The Coming soon section below was added.New featuresFeature
Ingress access logging is now a configurable feature called logging in versions 1.16.8-gke.10 and later. This allows Ingress access logging to be toggled on or off through the BackendConfig resource.
ChangesDeprecated
HTTP access logging for newly created Ingress resources is being deprecated across various GKE versions on May 12th, 2020. Any new Ingress resources created with the following versions after May 12th will have access logging disabled for that Ingress resource and will not record Ingress HTTP requests in Cloud Logging. Note that existing Ingress resources will continue to log HTTP requests unless the Ingress resource is redeployed. The following GKE versions are affected:
1.12
1.13
1.14 clusters less than 1.14.10-gke.30
1.15 clusters less than 1.15.9-gke.22
1.16 clusters less than 1.16.6-gke.12
Clusters whose masters are on 1.14.10-gke.30, 1.15.9-gke.22, 1.16.6-gke.12 or later versions are not impacted and HTTP access logging remains defaulted to ""on"" for all new and existing Ingress resources. If you're currently using access logging for GKE Ingress, we highly recommend upgrading to these versions or higher before May 12th to avoid loss of HTTP access logs for new Ingress resources.
In GKE 1.18, access logging will be changed to default to ""off"" for the GKE Ingress. Enabling access logging through the logging parameter is required to enable it for Ingress resources.
Coming soonGoogle Kubernetes Engine will gradually upgrade clusters in the regular channel to GKE 1.16 beginning on or after April 13, 2020."

1.16.8-gke.8 is now available in the Rapid release channel. The node image for Container-Optimized OS is updated to cos-77-12371-208-0.

Known issuesDue to the recent Windows Server security update provided by Microsoft in February 2020, a container incompatibility issue was introduced. To avoid disruption to your workloads, we have turned off Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) auto-upgrade for the impacted clusters.What do I need to know?As a consequence of Microsoft's security update, your workloads may end up in a failed state due to broken compatibility if the host Windows Server image has the security update and the container base image does not have the update.We have turned off auto-upgrade on the impacted GKE clusters to prevent this compatibility issue from affecting your workloads.The security update will be available in the rapid channel in GKE starting April 6, 2020. Beginning April 20, 2020, Windows Server container support in GKE, along with the security update will be available on the regular channel.What do I need to do?We strongly recommend you to rebuild your container images with the base Windows images that include Windows Updates from March 2020, then manually upgrade your node pool to the latest GKE version. Please follow the following steps:Disable auto-upgrade on the Windows node pool(s). When the first step is complete, Google will restart the cluster auto-upgrade. Please note that this could take a few days. The cluster's master and the Linux node pool(s) will be upgraded. The Windows node pool will not get upgraded as auto-upgrade is disabled in step number one. After the cluster master upgrade is complete and you have rebuilt your container images, manually upgrade your Windows node pool. After completing step number three, you can turn back on the auto-upgrade option. If you choose to turn the auto-upgrade option back on, please use multi-arch (or multi-platform) images to take advantage of the auto-upgrade feature.Incompatibility issues such as this one are a rare occurrence as it is against Microsoft's typical guidance for the security updates. Rest assured that if such issues occur again, we will keep you posted. Please stay up to date with GKE's release notes for the latest info.If you have any questions or require assistance, please email us or contact Google Cloud Support."

New versions of Cloud Composer images: composer-1.10.0-airflow-1.10.2, composer-1.10.0-airflow-1.10.3 and composer-1.10.0-airflow-1.10.6. The default is composer-1.10.0-airflow-1.10.2. Upgrade your Cloud SDK to use features in this release.

Feature

Improved Composer logs: Composer Agent adds more detailed logs in Cloud Monitoring to describe the current stage of environment creation and provide better error messages if an operation fails.
MySQL passwords are now stored in Kubernetes Secrets instead of the config map.
You can now set the core.store_serialized_dags property to False after setting it to True. (Previously it was not possible to switch back.)
Composer now uses Pip version 19.0.2 for both Python 2 and Python 3 Airflow environments.
Added the Airflow property core.store_dag_code, which lets you see DAG code in the web UI while VPC-SC is enabled.
New metrics have been added to the monitoring API. See the full list here. 

Fixed

Fixed an issue where Airflow database connection errors did not propagate correctly.
Logs from the Composer Agent will now show the correct severity level in Cloud Monitoring.
Fixed an issue where network tags added to environments did not propagate to the node pools created during the in-cluster image building. 
The Composer Agent will now wait for env_vars to be sent before starting the web server.
Backported a fix for SQL proxy, which improves the stability of SQL connections inside workers.
Added new scripts to handle synchronization of files from Customer Project buckets with tenant project buckets in DRS mode, so that DAG synchronization is not affected by long-running logs synchronization.
Fixed an issue that prevented the creation of environments in the same VPC but different regions.
Fixed an issue with updating the node count for Composer environments running versions 1.6.0 to 1.8.2.
Installing PyPI packages from private repositories in the public Internet (specified in the pip.conf file) now works in private IP Composer environments without having to configure Cloud NAT.

When you use runtime version 2.1 for online prediction, you can currently only deploy TensorFlow model versions.

Feature
When you train with runtime version 2.1 or later, AI Platform Training uses the chief task name to represent the master VM in the  TF_CONFIG environment variable. This environment variable is important for distributed training with TensorFlow. For runtime version 1.15 and earlier, AI Platform Training uses the master task name instead, but this task name is not supported in TensorFlow 2.
However, by default, AI Platform Training continues to use the master task name in custom container training jobs.

Fixed

Fixed an issue with updating Composer environments running versions 1.6.0 to 1.8.2. Updating the node count for an environment is still broken, and will be fixed in a future version. 

Workaround: To resize the cluster for an environment using version 1.6.0 - 1.8.2, resize the default node pool in the cluster directly through GKE interface, or delete the Composer environment and recreate it with a different node count.

Fixed an issue with the Dataflow Python hook for Airflow 1.10.6 that restricted it to using Python 2. Dataflow will now use the same Python version as the Composer environment.

Browser Support Policy:

For supported browsers, at the time of release, the latest stable version and the two previous stable versions are supported.
NOTE: Stable browser versions released after a given release of Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC. will NOT be supported for any prior version of Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC.. A best effort will be made to support newer versions released during the support lifecycle of the release.
For more information, see Desktop Requirements.

Deprecated
Re-run jobs using Cloud Dataflow templates:

In prior releases, you could re-run a Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC. job by configuring the Cloud Dataflow template with input and output parameters for the job.
As of this release, Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC. will continue to generate Cloud Dataflow templates, but they are no longer recommended for use in programmatic execution of Cloud Dataflow jobs.
Instead, you can now run jobs and monitor them through exposed API endpoints. For more information, see API Overview.
Support for Cloud Dataflow templates will be decommissioned in March 2020 (previously planned for Dec 2019)

Issue
issue
TD-47263: Importing an exported flow that references a Google Sheets or Excel source breaks connection to input source.

Workaround: If the importing user has access to the source, the user can re-import the dataset and then swap the source for the broken recipe.

Issue
TD-46185: Stepping backward to an early step in a recipe sometimes fails to properly update the state of the quality bar and histograms in the data grid.

Workaround: This issue is caused by caching of snapshot profiles from the data grid. The workaround is to reload the page through the browser.

Issue
TD-45122: API: re-running job using only the wrangleDataset identifier fails even if the original job succeeds when writeSettings were specified.

Workaround: Use a full jobGroups job specification each time that you run a job. See API JobGroups Create v4.

Affected versions: 1.2.0-gke.6
In some cases, certain nodes in a user cluster fail to get routing updates from the route reflector. Consequently Pods on a node may not be able to communicate with Pods on other nodes. One possible symptom is a kube-dns resolution error.
To work around this issue, follow these steps to create a BGPPeer object in your user cluster.
Save the following BGPPeer manifest as full-mesh.yaml:
apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: full-mesh
spec:
  nodeSelector: ""!has(route-reflector)""
  peerSelector: ""!has(route-reflector)"" 

Create the BGPPeer in your user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] apply -f full-mesh.yaml
Verify that the full-mesh BGPPeer was created:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] get bgppeer
The output shows full-mesh in the list of BGPPeers:
NAME            AGE
  full-mesh       61s

Warning: If you installed GKE on-prem versions before 1.2, and you use a vSAN datastore, you should contact Google Support before attempting an upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6.
GKE on-prem version 1.2.0-gke.6 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem.
This minor version includes the following changes:
Feature
The default Kubernetes version for cluster nodes is now version 1.14.7-gke.24 (previously 1.13.7-gke.20).
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports vSphere 6.7 Update 3. Read its release notes.
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports VMware NSX-T version 2.4.2.
Feature
Any user cluster, even your first use cluster, can now use a datastore that is separate from the admin cluster's datastore. If you specify a separate datastore for a user cluster, the user cluster nodes, PersistentVolumes (PVs) for the user cluster nodes, user control plane VMs, and PVs for the user control plane VMs all use the separate datastore.
Feature
Expanded preflight checks for validating your GKE on-prem configuration file before your create your clusters. These new checks can validate that your Google Cloud project, vSphere network, and other elements of your environment are correctly configured.
Feature
Published basic installation workflow. This workflow offers a simplified workflow for quickly installing GKE on-prem using static IPs.
Feature
Published guidelines for installing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. CSI enables using storage devices not natively supported by Kubernetes.
Feature
Updated documentation for authenticating using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with the Anthos Plugin for Kubectl. GKE on-prem's OIDC integration is now generally available.
Changed
From the admin workstation, gcloud now requires that you log in to gcloud with a Google Cloud user account. The user account should have at least the Viewer Cloud IAM role in all Google Cloud projects associated with your clusters.
Changed
You can now create admin and user clusters separately from one another.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that prevented resuming cluster creation for HA user clusters.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.1.0-gke.6, 1.2.0-gke.6
The stackdriver.proxyconfigsecretname field was removed in version 1.1.0-gke.6. GKE on-prem's preflight checks will return an error if the field is present in your configuration file.
To work around this, before you install or upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6, delete the proxyconfigsecretname field from your configuration file.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.2.0-6-gke.6
In user clusters, Prometheus and Grafana get automatically disabled during upgrade. However, the configuration and metrics data are not lost. In admin clusters, Prometheus and Grafana stay enabled.
To work around this issue, after the upgrade, open monitoring-sample for editing and set enablePrometheus to true:
1.kubectl edit monitoring --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] \ -n kube-system monitoring-sample
2.
Set the field enablePrometheus to true.
Issue
Affected versions: All versions
Before version 1.2.0-gke.6, a known issue prevents Stackdriver from updating its configuration after cluster upgrades. Stackdriver still references an old version, which prevents Stackdriver from receiving the latest features of its telemetry pipeline. This issue can make it difficult for Google Support to troubleshoot clusters.
After you upgrade clusters to 1.2.0-gke.6, run the following command against admin and user clusters:
kubectl --kubeconfig=[KUBECONFIG] \
-n kube-system --type=json patch stackdrivers stackdriver \
-p '[{""op"":""remove"",""path"":""/spec/version""}]'

where [KUBECONFIG] is the path to the cluster's kubeconfig file."

Rollouts begin on the day of the note and take four or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. For more information, see the Rollout schedule.New versions available for upgrades and new clustersThe following Kubernetes versions are now available for new clusters and for opt-in master upgrades and node upgrades for existing clusters. See these instructions for more information on the Kubernetes versioning scheme.
No Channelv.1.12.x
1.12.10-gke.22
v.1.15.x
1.15.4-gke.22

GKE 1.15 is generally available for new clusters.

Upgrading
Before creating GKE v1.15 clusters, you must review the known issues and urgent upgrade notes.
New features

By default, firewall rules restrict your cluster master to only initiate TCP connections to your nodes on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 10250 (kubelet). For some Kubernetes features, you might need to add firewall rules to allow access on additional ports. For example, in Kubernetes 1.9 and older, kubectl top accesses heapster, which needs a firewall rule to allow TCP connections on port 8080. To grant such access, you can add firewall rules.


Node-local DNS caching is now available in beta. This does create a single point of failure. If the node-cache goes down DNS for all Pods on that node will be broken until the cache is up.

Known Issues

There is a low risk that consumers of the published OpenAPI document that made assumptions about the absence of schema info for a given type (for example, ""no schema info means a resource is a custom resource"") could have those assumptions broken once custom resources start publishing schema definitions.

Starting January 1, 2020, the Python Software Foundation will no longer support Python 2.7. Accordingly, any runtime versions released after January 1, 2020 will not support Python 2.7.
Changed
Note: The following change has been delayed. There will be an additional announcement to affected customers before it goes into effect.
Starting on January 13, 2020, AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction will support each runtime version for one year after its release date. You can find the release date of each runtime version in the runtime version list.
Support for each runtime version changes according to the following schedule:

Starting on the release date: You can create training jobs, batch prediction jobs, and model versions that use the runtime version.
Starting 12 months after the release date: You can no longer create training jobs, batch prediction jobs, or model versions that use the runtime version.
Existing model versions that have been deployed to AI Platform Prediction continue to function.
24 months after the release date: AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes all model versions that use the runtime version.

This policy will be applied retroactively on January 13, 2020. For example, since runtime version 1.0 was released over 24 months ago, AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction no longer support it. There will be a three-month grace period (until April 13, 2020) before AI Platform Prediction automatically deletes model versions that use the oldest runtime versions.
The following table describes the first two important dates that mark the end of support for runtime versions:

Cloud IAM policies now identify deleted members that are bound to a role. Deleted members have the prefix deleted: and the suffix ?uid=[NUMERIC_ID].
For example, if you delete the account for the user bob@example.com, and a policy binds that user to a role, the policy shows an identifier similar to deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901.
For SetIamPolicy requests, you can use this new syntax starting today. For GetIamPolicy and SetIamPolicy responses, because we are still rolling out this change, you might see the new prefix and suffix in some, but not all, responses. We expect to complete the rollout by December 13, 2019.
Issue
If a binding in a policy refers to a deleted member (for example, deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901), you cannot add a binding for a newly created member with the same name (in this case, user:bob@example.com). If you try to add a binding for the newly created member, Cloud IAM will apply the binding to the deleted member instead."

Cloud TPU v2 and v3 Pods are now Generally Available for TensorFlow version 1.x. Supported models can be found here.
Since TPU resources can scale from a single Cloud TPU to a Cloud TPU Pod, you don't need to choose between a single Cloud TPU and a Cloud TPU Pod. You can request portions of Cloud TPU Pods in slices or sets of cores, so that you purchase only the processing power you need.
Cloud TPU v2 and v3 Pod advantages over a single v2 or v3 Cloud TPU device:

Increased training speeds for fast iteration in R&D
*Increased human productivity by providing automatically scalable machine learning (ML) compute
Ability to train much larger models

Cloud TPU v3 Pod advantages over Cloud TPU v2 Pod:

Faster processing and larger memory:

v2 Pod: 11.5 petaflops and 4 TB on-chip memory (HBM)
v3 Pod: 100 petaflops and 32 TB HBM, with liquid cooling* Can train even larger models

Image Classification General Availability (GA) release
Some notes about the GA release:

Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge are now in General Availability (GA). The Service Level Agreement has been published.
We've introduced a new version (v1) of the Cloud AutoML API. The current version (v1beta1) is deprecated and is scheduled for deletion within six months. As a result, you will need to migrate your applications from the v1beta1 version to the v1 version. If you have integrated with the Create Dataset API, you will also need to change your code to reflect changes with v1 version integration.

Creating dataset will now return an Operation, whose status must be requested to detect completion.
Both dataset and model can be updated using patch, with a field mask that can include labels and displayName for both, and description only for dataset.
In ModelEvaluation, baseAuPrc has been deprecated. This is the Area Under Precision-Recall Curve metric based on priors.
Specifying an Image is the only option for ExamplePayload of online prediction. The inputConfig option was not supported and has been deleted.

The maximum supported lifespan for custom models created in Cloud AutoML Vision and AutoML Vision Edge has changed from two years to 18 months. 
The new pricing for Image Classification is effective November 21, 2019 at 12 AM Pacific Time. For further information, including pricing examples, please refer to our pricing page. 
Image Classification models trained prior to the Beta Refresh release of October 9, 2019, will serve online predictions under the old pricing structure until you redeploy. Online predictions from these models will stop on February 21, 2020, unless you redeploy.

Breaking
Breaking Changes:

Dataproc will no longer accept requests to create new clusters using Debian 8 images. Existing clusters that are using Debian 8 can still be used and scaled.
The alpha version of the Kerberos optional component option has been removed from the v1beta2 API. To use Kerberos, please configure it via the SecurityConfig message instead.
Disallow setting or overriding goog-dataproc-* labels when creating or updating clusters. All attempts to set goog-dataproc-* labels on creation will be ignored. Any existing custom goog-dataproc-* labels on running clusters will be removed if cluster labels are updated, and attempts to add new custom goog-dataproc-* labels to existing clusters will be ignored.
Reset autoscaling if the same or a new autoscaling policy is attached to a cluster. E.g. through gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<policy-name>. Note that resetting autoscaling does not change the cluster's status. Autoscaling will only run while the cluster's status is RUNNING or UPDATING, and does not work if the cluster is in ERROR. In addition, if the cluster was previously resizing (UPDATING), the autoscaler will not be able to scale the cluster until the previous update operation has completed.

Also fixes an issue where autoscaling would not reset correctly if autoscaling was disabled then re-enabled with the same within 30 seconds. Running gcloud dataproc clusters update --disable-autoscaling and then gcloud dataproc clusters update --autoscaling-policy=<same-policy> should now correctly reset autoscaling regardless of how long autoscaling was disabled.


Fixed

Fixed race condition where deleting a cluster shortly after updating it would not delete all of the cluster's VMs
Allow compute resource names with an Alpha API version. For example: https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/alpha/projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network.

This allows gcloud alpha dataproc clusters create <cluster-name> --network=my-network to succeed, since gcloud sets the compute API version to the same as the gcloud command track.

GKE On-Prem's configuration file has a field, vcenter.datadisk, which looks for a path to a virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. During installation, you choose a name for the VMDK. By default, GKE On-Prem creates a VMDK and saves it to the root of your vSphere datastore.
If you are using a vSAN datastore, you need to create a folder in the datastore in which to save the VMDK. You provide the full path to the field—for example, datadisk: gke-on-prem/datadisk.vmdk—and GKE On-Prem saves the VMDK in that folder.
When you create the folder, vSphere assigns the folder a universally unique identifier (UUID). Although you provide the folder path to the GKE On-Prem config, the vSphere API looks for the folder's UUID. Currently, this mismatch can cause cluster creation and upgrades to fail.
A fix is targeted for version 1.1.2. In the meantime, you need to provide the folder's UUID instead of the folder's path. Follow the workaround instructions currently available in the upgrading clusters and installation topics."

Issue
Known Issues
Issue
For user clusters that are using static IPs and a different network than their admin cluster: If you overwrite the user cluster's network configuration, the user control plane might not be able to start. This occurs because it's using the user cluster's network, but allocates an IP address and gateway from the admin cluster.
As a workaround, you can update each user control plane's MachineDeployment specification to use the correct network. Then, delete each user control plane Machine, causing the MachineDeployment to create new Machines:

List MachineDeployments in the admin cluster
kubectl get machinedeployments --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

Update a user control plane MachineDeployment from your shell
kubectl edit machinedeployment --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] [MACHINEDEPLOYMENT_NAME]

Avoid Unnecessary Classification Model Deployment Charges at GA

Review each project's Models. You can review your models by: 

Visit the Google Cloud Console project selector dashboard to access each of your projects in turn. 
From each project page, click the top left navigation menu (hamburger icon), scroll down and select Vision dashboard (Artificial Intelligence > Vision). 
From the Vision dashboard, select the Image Classification card under AutoML Vision. If dataset migration has completed for your project, you will be redirected to access the UI shared with Object Detection. Some customers will not be redirected in this step today, and must complete the following steps when redirection works. If you cannot complete them by October 31st, 2019, join the cloud-vision-discuss Google group to request assistance. 

The UI will display your existing Classification models as deployed with '0 nodes'. This indicates that they are still deployed on the old online prediction service. 
Redeploy active Image Classification models or update model's node number to adjust online prediction queries served per second, Each node that is selected for deployment will incur hourly charge of $1.25 (USD) at GA. 
When you are done with these steps, no Classification model should be left in initial state, deployed with '0 nodes'. Each model left in this state will serve online predictions from the old service, but will be excluded from our Service Level Agreement offered at GA, and will be undeployed on February 21, 2020.

AutoML Translation is now generally available. Translations are now faster and quality should be improved or on par with previous versions; individual results will vary depending on your datasets. In addition, quality improvements can vary across language pairs.
Changed
Model lifetime  AutoML Models run on a managed platform that is regularly upgraded. AutoML Models need to be re-trained at least every 18 months to ensure consistent performance and stability in translations over time and to get any benefits of the upgrades since original training. Models created before AutoML GA (for example, models created during service Alpha /Beta) need to be  re-trained within 18 months of GA to move all assets to the newest version of the platform. 
Feature
AutoML Translation has upgraded its Google NMT base models onto a new training architecture so that it now runs end-to-end on upgraded
TPUs. Going forward, all training using Google NMT as the base model trains and serves on TPUs.
Changed
Customers already using AutoML might experience additional differences between v1 and previous versions of the service:

Data validation now provides warnings on data import to
indicate certain data is not usable for training jobs.
Data import takes longer in order to support data validation. 
To achieve higher quality on the new 
architecture, training durations are longer.

Image Classification Beta Refresh
Image Classification Beta Refresh has been released. The unified infrastructure now supports both Classification and Object Detection as model objectives.

Dataset migration for existing Classification projects is ongoing. Unless your project has migrated, the issue published below on September 30, 2019 will continue to be relevant for you. Please follow instructions there.
New  projects created after this release will not have this restriction. Selecting Classification as an option while creating a new dataset in the User Interface for Object Detection will succeed for them.

The following features that Classification customers had been used to will not be available in the unified infrastructure:

Integrated Human labeling; alternatively, you can use Cloud AI Platform Data Labeling Service.
Automated deployment of models will happen if you opt-in; you can manually deploy and set the number of nodes on which your model(s) are deployed. Both the UI and the API support this feature.

Changed
Model deployment & undeployment
Starting with this release, users must deploy their trained models before they are able to make predictions with them. They will also need to undeploy models to avoid incurring deployment charges when Classification models switch to deployment-based pricing for online predictions at General Availability later in 2019.

New Dataset Issue for Image Classification
On September 30, we begin migrating Classification datasets, prioritizing the projects created since July 2018 beta release of this feature. Following migration, creation of Classification datasets will succeed in the UI for Object Detection for these projects even before the Beta Refresh release. So the above caveats stop applying when dataset migrations is done, and the project is redirected to the unified UI.
The How-to Guides for Object Detection can be used temporarily to understand how tasks such as deploying and undeploying models are done in the unified UI. These changes will be reflected in the Classification documentation by the Beta Refresh release date.
Some caveats until AutoML Vision announces Beta Refresh release:

Selecting Classification as an option while creating a new dataset in the User Interface for Object Detection  will succeed, but will block further progress.
Importing data into this dataset will fail.  These release notes will be updated when this issue has been resolved.
To avoid this issue, please continue creating new Classification datasets in the UI for Image Classification.
Until our Beta Refresh release, separate selection cards for Image Classification and Object Detection will be available in the Vision Dashboard.
Following the release, these two cards will be replaced by single AutoML Vision card, and new Classification datasets will not be subject to this issue.

Feature
The default Kubernetes version for cluster nodes is now version 1.13.7-gke.20 (previously 1.12.7-gke.19).
Feature
Action required: As of version 1.1.0-gke.6, GKE On-Prem now creates vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) rules for your user cluster's nodes (vSphere VMs), causing them to be spread across at least three physical hosts in your datacenter.
This feature is enabled by default for all new and existing user clusters running version 1.1.0-gke.6.
The feature requires that your vSphere environment meets the following conditions:

VMware DRS must be enabled. VMware DRS requires vSphere Enterprise Plus license edition. To learn how to enable DRS, see Enabling VMware DRS in a cluster.
The vSphere user account provided in your GKE On-Prem configuration file's vcenter field must have the Host.Inventory.EditCluster permission.
There are at least three physical hosts available.

If you do not want to enable this feature for your existing user clusters—for example, if you don't have enough hosts to accommdate the feature—perform the following steps before you upgrade your user clusters:

Open your existing GKE On-Prem configuration file.
Under the usercluster specification, add the antiaffinitygroups field as described in the antiaffinitygroups documentation:
usercluster:
          ...
          antiaffinitygroups:
            enabled: false
Save the file.
Use the configuration file to upgrade. Your clusters are upgraded, but the feature is not enabled.

Feature
You can now set the default storage class for your clusters.
Feature
You can now use Container Storage Interface (CSI) 1.0 as a storage class for your clusters.
Feature
You can now delete broken or unhealthy user clusters with gkectl delete cluster --force
Feature
You can now diagnose node issues using the debug-toolbox container image.
Feature
You can now skip validatations run by gkectl commands.
Feature

Changed
The gkeplatformversion field has been removed from the GKE On-Prem configuration file. To specify a cluster's version, provide the version's bundle to the bundlepath field.
Changed
You need to add the vSphere permission, Host.Inventory.EditCluster, before you can use antiaffinitygroups.
Changed
You now specify a configuration file in gkectl diagnose snapshot by passing the --snapshot-config (previously --config). See Diagnosing cluster issues.
Changed
You now capture your cluster's configuration file with gkectl diagnose snapshot by passing --snapshot-config (previously --config). See Diagnosing cluster issues.
Changed
gkectl diagnose commands now return an error if you provide a user cluster's kubeconfig, rather than an admin cluster's kubeconfig.

Beginning in this release, you can use token-based security to manage the launching and execution of Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC. jobs. For more information, see API Overview.
This API should be used as a replacement for Cloud Dataflow templates for programmatic invocation of Cloud Dataprep jobs. In addition, this feature includes support for dynamic functions and input & output destinations.

In prior releases, you could re-run a Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC.job by configuring the Cloud Dataflow template with input and output parameters for the job.
As of this release, Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA INC. will continue to generate Cloud Dataflow templates, but they are no longer recommended for use in programmatic execution of Cloud Dataflow jobs.
Instead, you can now run jobs and monitor them through exposed API endpoints. For more information, see API Overview.
Support for Cloud Dataflow templates will be decommissioned in December 2019.

GKE On-Prem is now generally available. Version 1.0.10 includes the following changes:
Changed
Upgrading from beta-1.4 to 1.0.10
Before upgrading your beta clusters to the first general availability version, perform the steps described in Upgrading from GKE On-Prem beta to general availability, and review the following points:

If you are running a beta version before beta-1.4, be sure to upgrade to beta-1.4 first.
If your beta clusters are running their own L4 load balancers (not the default, F5 BIG-IP), you need to delete and recreate your clusters to run the latest GKE On-Prem version.
If your clusters were upgraded to beta-1.4 from beta-1.3, run the following command for each user cluster before upgrading:
kubectl delete crd networkpolicies.crd.projectcalico.org
vCenter certificate verification is now required. (vsphereinsecure is no longer supported.) If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.
You need to upgrade all of your running clusters. For this upgrade to succeed, your clusters can't run in a mixed version state.
You need to upgrade your admin clusters to the latest version first, then upgrade your user clusters.

Feature
New Features
Feature
You can now enable the Manual load balancing mode to configure a L4 load balancer. You can still choose to use the default load balancer, F5 BIG-IP.
Feature
GKE On-Prem's configuration-driven installation process has been updated. You now declaratively install using a singular configuration file.
Feature
Adds gkectl create-config, which generates a configuration file for installing GKE On-Prem, upgrading existing clusters, and for creating additional user clusters in an existing installation. This replaces the installation wizard and create-config.yaml from previous versions. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.
Feature
Adds gkectl check-config, which validates the GKE On-Prem configuration file. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.
Feature
Adds an optional --validate-attestations flag to gkectl prepare. This flag verifies that the container images included in your admin workstationwere built and signed by Google and are ready for deployment. See the updated documentation for installing GKE On-Prem.
Changed
Changes
Changed
Upgrades Kubernetes version to 1.12.7-gke.19. You can now upgrade your clusters to this version. You can no longer create clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.11.2-gke.19.
We recommend upgrading your admin cluster before you upgrade your user clusters.
Changed
Upgrades Istio ingress controller to version 1.1.7.
Changed
vCenter certificate verification is now required. vsphereinsecure is no longer supported). You provide the certificate in the GKE On-Prem configration file's cacertpath field.
When a client calls the vCenter server, the vCenter server must prove its identity to the client by presenting a certificate. That certificate must be signed by a certificate authority (CA). The certificate is must not be self-signed.
If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.
Issue
Known Issues
Issue
Upgrading clusters can cause disruption or downtime for workloads that use PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).
Issue
You might not be able to upgrade beta clusters that use the Manual load balancing mode to GKE On-Prem version 1.0.10. To upgrade and continue using your own load balancer with these clusters, you need to recreate the clusters."

Changes
Changed
On May 8, 2019, we introduced a change to Connect, the service that enables you to interact with your GKE On-Prem clusters using Cloud Console. To use the new Connect agent, you must re-register your clusters with Cloud Console, or you must upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
Your GKE On-Prem clusters and the workloads running on them will continue to operate uninterrupted. However, your clusters will not be visible in Cloud Console until you re-register them or upgrade to beta-1.4.
Before you re-register or upgrade, make sure your service account has the gkehub.connect role. Also, if your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, it's a good idea to remove that role.
Grant your service account the gkehub.connect role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \n      --member=""serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \n      --role=""roles/gkehub.connect""
If your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, remove the old role:
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \n      --member=""serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \n      --role=""roles/clusterregistry.connect""
Re-register you cluster, or upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
To re-register your cluster:
gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster [CLUSTER_NAME] \n      --context=[USER_CLUSTER_CONTEXT] \n      --service-account-key-file=[LOCAL_KEY_PATH] \n      --kubeconfig-file=[KUBECONFIG_PATH] \n      --project=[PROJECT_ID]
      
To upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4:
gkectl upgrade --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

There is an issue that prevents the Connect agent from being updated to the new version during an upgrade. To work around this issue, run the following command after you upgrade a cluster:

Known Issues
Issue
Clusters upgraded from version beta-1.2 to beta-1.3 might be affected by a known issue that damages the cluster's configuration file and prevents future cluster upgrades. This issue affects all future cluster upgrades.
You can resolve this issue by deleting and recreating clusters upgraded from beta-1.2 to beta-1.3.
To resolve the issue without deleting and recreating the cluster, you need to re-encode and apply each cluster's Secrets. Perform the following steps:

Get the contents of the create-config Secrets stored in the admin cluster. This must be done for the create-config Secret in the kube-system namespace, and for thecreate-config Secrets in each user cluster's namespace:
kubectl get secret create-config -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > kube-system_create_secret.yaml
kubectl get secret create-config -n [USER_CLUSTER_NAME] -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml
For each user cluster, open the <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml file in an editor. If the values for registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey are not REDACTED, no further action is required: the Secrets do not need to be re-encoded and written to the cluster.
Open the original create_config.yaml file in another editor.
In <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml, replace the registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey values with the values from the original create_config.yaml file. Save the changed file.
Repeat steps 3-5 for each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml, and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file.
Base64-encode each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml file and the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file:
cat [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml | base64 > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret_create_secret.b64
cat kube-system-cluster_create_secret.yaml | base64 >kube-system-cluster_create_secret.b64
Replace the data[cfg] field in each Secret in the cluster with the contents of the corresponding file:
kubectl edit secret create-config -n [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]

  # kubectl edit opens the file in the shell's default text editor
  # Open `first-user-cluster_create_secret.b64` in another editor, and replace
  # the `cfg` value with the copied value
  # Make sure the copied string has no newlines in it!
Repeat step 8 for each <var>[USER_CLUSTER_NAME]</var>_create_secret.yaml Secret, and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml Secret.
To ensure that the update was successful, repeat step 1.

Changes
Changed
On May 8, 2019, we introduced a change to Connect, the service that enables you to interact with your GKE On-Prem clusters using Cloud Console. To use the new Connect agent, you must re-register your clusters with Cloud Console, or you must upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
Your GKE On-Prem clusters and the workloads running on them will continue to operate uninterrupted. However, your clusters will not be visible in Cloud Console until you re-register them or upgrade to beta-1.4.
Before your re-register or upgrade, make sure your service account has the gkehub.connect role. Also, if your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, it's a good idea to remove that role.
Grant your service account the gkehub.connect role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \n      --member=""serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \n      --role=""roles/gkehub.connect""
If your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, remove the old role:
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \n      --member=""serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \n      --role=""roles/clusterregistry.connect""
Re-register you cluster, or upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
To re-register your cluster:
gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster [CLUSTER_NAME] \n      --context=[USER_CLUSTER_CONTEXT] \n      --service-account-key-file=[LOCAL_KEY_PATH] \n      --kubeconfig-file=[KUBECONFIG_PATH] \n      --project=[PROJECT_ID]
      
To upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4:
gkectl upgrade --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

TD-39411: Cannot import BigQuery table or view when source is originally from Google Suite.

Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA only supports native BigQuery tables and views. Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA does not support BigQuery sources that reference data stored in Google Suite, such as Google Sheets.
Workaround: Create a copy of the BigQuery table linked to the Google Suite source within BigQuery. Then, import the native BigQuery table as a dataset in Cloud Dataprep by TRIFACTA using the Import Dataset page.

TD-39386: Some users may not be able to edit datasets with parameters, receiving an HTTP 403 error (permission denied) on sources that should be accessible.

Workaround: Generate source using another supported file format or union all Parquet-sourced datasets as first step.

TD-39295: Parquet jobs fail on Cloud Dataflow when dataset contains columns of INT96 data type.

Workaround: Data type INT96 has been deprecated from the library used to convert Parquet data. Please change the source to another data type and re-import. For more information, see PARQUET-1480 on GitHub.

TD-39173: Cannot preview imported datasets when source is Avro file.

Workaround: File can still be imported and wrangled.

TD-38869: Upload of Parquet files does not support nested values, which appear as null values in the Transformer page.

Workaround: Unnest the values before importing into the platform.

TD-37688: Documentation for new Selection Details Panel was not updated.

The Selection Details panel replaces and extends the Suggestion Cards Panel. The feature is present, while the documentation is outdated.
Updated documentation will be available in the next release.
Workaround: Documentation for the new Selection Details panel is available here: Selection Details Panel.

TD-37683: Send a copy does not create independent sets of recipes and datasets in new flow. If imported datasets are removed in the source flow, they disappear from the sent version.

Workaround: Create new versions of the imported datasets in the sent flow.


Fixed

TD-36332: Data grid can display wrong results if a sample is collected and dataset is unioned.
TD-36192: Canceling a step in recipe panel can result in column menus disappearing in the data grid.
TD-31252: Assigning a target schema through the Column Browser does not refresh the page.
DP-98: BigQuery does not support reading from tables stored in regions other than US or EU.

In a specific case, users of Apache Beam Java SDKs (2.9.0 and earlier) and Cloud Dataflow Java SDKs (2.5.0 and earlier) might experience data duplication when reading files from Cloud Storage. Duplication might occur when all of the following conditions are true:

You are reading files with the content-encoding set to gzip, and the files are dynamically decompressive transcoded by Cloud Storage.
The file size (decompressed) is larger than 2.14 GB.
The input stream runs into an error (and is recreated) after 2.14 GB is read.

Because VPC Service Controls does not currently support folder and organization resources, log exports of folder-level and organization-level logs (including aggregate logs) do not support service perimeters.
Aggregated Stackdriver Logging logs can access data protected by a service perimeter. Cloud IAM should be used to control access to that data.

Issue

TD-34574: BigQuery tables and views with NUMERIC data type cannot be imported.

Workaround: Cast the NUMERIC type to FLOAT, and the import should succeed.
NOTE: Support for NUMERIC data type for BigQuery began on August 20, 2018. For details, see BigQuery Release Notes.
Support for NUMERIC data type in is planned for a future release.

TD-34061: Running jobs on datasets sourced from more than 6000 files may fail.
NOTE: Due to a limitation in Cloud Dataflow, when you run a job on a parameterized dataset containing more than 1000 files, the input paths data must be compressed, which results in non-readable location values in the Cloud Dataflow job details.
Workaround: For this and other performance reasons, try to limit your parameterized datasets to no more than 5000 source files.
TD-33428: Job execution on recipe with high limit in split transformation due to Java Null Pointer Error during profiling.
NOTE: Avoid creating datasets that are wider than 2500 columns. Performance can degrade significantly on very wide datasets.

Fixed

TD-33901: Cannot sort flows by name in Flows page.
TD-33900: When headers use protected names, the columns may be renamed.
TD-33888: 'Unable to load wrangled Dataset Script is malformed (Cannot read property 'push' of undefined)"" error when opening recipe with Case transformations.
TD-33798: ""Could not create dataset"" error when importing Avro dataset from Cloud Storage.
TD-33797: Status icon for the active job in Jobs page flickers as you move the mouse.
TD-33108: Textbox for name of reference object in Flow View appears stretched.
TD-32123: Window transformation doesn't handle order parameter in descending order.

Redesigned Jobs page: In the new Jobs page, you can more easily locate and review all jobs to which you have access. See Jobs Page.
Introducing pre-defined transformations for common tasks: Through the context panel, you can search across dozens of pre-defined transformations. Select one, and the Transform Builder is pre-populated based on the current context in the data grid or column browser.

See Search Panel.
See Transform Builder.

New Transformer toolbar: New toolbar provides faster access to common transformations and operations. See Transformer Toolbar.
Match your recipe to the target: Assign a new target to your recipes to provide matching guidance during wrangling. See Overview of Target Matching.

Targets assigned to a recipe appear in a column header overlay to assist you in aligning your dataset to match the dataset schema to the target schema. See Data Grid Panel.

Cancel sampling jobs: Cancel in-progress sampling jobs. See Samples Panel.
Improved column matching: Better intelligence for column matching during union operations. See Union Page.
Improved Join page: Numerous functional improvements to the Join page. See Join Page.

Issue

TD-31305: Copying a flow invalidates the samples in the new copy. Copying or moving a node within a flow invalidates the node's samples.

This issue also applies to flows that were upgraded from a previous release.
Workaround: Recreate the samples after the move or copy.

TD-31252: Assigning a target schema through the Column Browser does not refresh the page.

Workaround: To update the page, reload the page through the browser.

TD-31165: Job results are incorrect when a sample is collected and then the last transform step is undone.

Workaround: Recollect a sample after undoing the transform step.

TD-30857: Matching file path patterns in a large directory can be very slow, especially if using multiple patterns in a single dataset with parameters.

Workaround: To increase matching speed, avoid wildcards in top-level directories and be as specific as possible with your wildcards and patterns.

TD-28807: You may receive a Nothing Found message when navigating to a BigQuery project that contains data. With your BigQuery administrator, please verify that the service account in use has been properly set up and has the appropriate permissions so that you can use the project.

Fixed

TD-31339: Writing to a single file in the top-level directory fails if the temporary output generates more than 32 files.
TD-29149: Columns containing String values with leading spaces are incorrectly type cast to Integer data type.
TD-28930: Delete other columns causes column lineage to be lost and reorders columns.
TD-26069: Photon evaluates date(yr, month, 0) as first date of the previous month. It should return a null value.

Feature

Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:

Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests, which are the first request to a new instance.
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic. The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.
For more details, see the auto scaling documentation.

AutoML Vision Alpha has been released. Some notes about the alpha release:

You can access the AutoML Vision Alpha UI at http://beta-dot-custom-vision.appspot.com.
You can now perform all of your AutoML Vision tasks using the AutoML API. Create datasets, train models, make predictions, and much more. For details, see Cloud-hosted model quickstart.
Making a prediction for an image is no longer supported by the images:annotate method of the Cloud Vision API. Instead, use the predict method of the AutoML API.
The AutoML Vision Alpha UI does not currently include the ability to list the models that have been trained for a dataset.
You can currently only supply base64-encoded image content to the predict method. For an example, see Make a prediction.

This option configures ESP to use the latest deployed service configuration. When you specify this option, within a minute after you deploy a new service configuration, ESP detects the change and automatically begins using it. We recommend that you specify this option instead of a specific configuration ID for ESP to use.This option is not available in Endpoints Frameworks.Although the managed rollout option has been available in ESP since version 1.7.0, the gcloud command line tool has now been updated to make the option available on the App Engine flexible environment. Currently, the option is available only in the beta version of the gcloud command line tool. After you add the option to your app.yaml, you will need to use the gcloud beta app deploy command to deploy your API and ESP.For information on deploying ESP with this new option, see the documentation for your API implementation:Endpoints OpenAPI documentation
Endpoints gRPC documentationLibrary and Plugin UpdatesThe Endpoints Frameworks for Python library, version 3.0.0, contains potentially breaking changes. It is now possible to deploy a single service comprising multiple APIs. However, there are additional restrictions on API names when using this functionality. See Deploying and Testing an API for more details.
Previously, API version strings were embedded in the path as-is. For example, an API echo with version v1 would have a path like /echo/v1. This continues to be the case for API version strings that are not compatible with the SemVer standard. If the string is compatible with the SemVer standard, the major version number will be extracted and embedded in the path when you deploy your API. So, for example, an API called echo with version 2.1.0 would have a path like /echo/v2. If you update the echo API to version 2.2.0 and deploy a backwards-compatible change, the path remains /echo/v2. This allows you to update the API version number when you make a backwards-compatible change without breaking existing paths for your clients. But if you update the echo API to version 3.0.0 (because you are deploying a breaking change), the path is changed to /echo/v3."

Announcing Cloud Dataprep Beta 5 release. The following is a list of release features, changes, deprecations, issues, and fixes:
New Flow View page: New objects in Flow View and better organization of them. See Flow View Page.
BigQuery read/write access across projects:

Read from BigQuery tables associated with GCP projects other than the current one where Cloud Dataprep was launched.
Write results into BigQuery tables associated with other projects.
You must configure Cloud Dataprep & Cloud Dataflow service accounts to have read or write access to BigQuery datasets and tables outside of the current GCP project.

Re-run job on Cloud Dataflow:

After you run a job in Cloud Dataprep, you can re-run the job directly from the Cloud Dataflow interface.
Inputs and outputs are parameters that you can modify.
Operationalize the job with a third-party scheduling tool.
See Run Job on Dataflow.

Cross joins: Perform cross joins between datasets. See Join Page.
Enable or disable type inference on files and tables: Enable (default) or disable initial type inference for BigQuery tables or Avro files used as sources for individual datasets. See Import Data Page.
Batch column rename: Rename multiple columns in a single transformation step. See Rename Columns.
Reuse your common patterns: Browse and select patterns for re-use from your recent history. See Pattern History Panel.
Convert phone and date patterns:

In Column Details, you can select a phone number or date pattern to generate suggestions for standardizing the values in the column to a single format.
See Column Details Panel.

New string comparison functions:

STRINGLESSTHAN Function
STRINGLESSTHANEQUAL Function
STRINGGREATERTHAN Function
STRINGGREATERTHANEQUAL Function

New SUBSTITUTE function: Replace string literals or patterns with a new literal or column value. See SUBSTITUTE Function.

Changed
New Flow Objects: The objects in your flow have been modified and expanded to provide greater flexibility in flow definition and re-use:

References: Create references to the outputs of your recipes and use them as inputs to other recipes.
Output object: Specify individual publishing outputs in a separate object associated with a recipe. Publishing options include format, location, and data type.
For more information, see Object Overview.

Announcing a Cloud Dataprep release, which highlights a revamped UI, scheduling, improved sampling, and several other minor features. The following is a list of release features, changes, deprecations, issues, and fixes:
Interactive Getting Started Tutorial for New Users: New users to Cloud Dataprep can review the ""Getting Started 101"" tutorial with pre-loaded data through the product.
Scheduling: Schedule execution of one or more wrangled datasets within a flow. Scheduled jobs must be configured from Flow View. See Flow View Page.
New Transformer page: New navigation and layout for the Transformer page simplifies working with data and increases the area of the data grid. See Transformer Page.
Transformation suggestions are now displayed in a right-side panel, instead of on the bottom of the page. A preview for a transformation suggestion is displayed only when you hover over the suggestion.
Improved sampling: Enhanced sampling methods provide access to customizable, task-oriented subsets of your data. See Samples Panel.
Improved Transformer loading due to persistence of initial sample. For more information on the new sampling methods, see Overview of Sampling.
Improved Flow View: Improved user experience with flows. See Flow View Page.
Disable steps: Disable individual steps in your recipes. See Recipe Panel.
Set encoding settings during import: You can define per-file import settings including file encoding type and automated structure detection. See Import Dataset Page.
Snappy compression: Read/write support for Snappy compression. See Supported File Formats.
Column lineage: Highlight the recipe steps where a specific column is referenced. See Column Menus.
Search for columns: Search for columns by name. See Data Grid Panel.
CASE Function: Build multi-conditional expressions with a single CASE statement. See CASE Function.
Support for BigQuery Datetime: Publish Cloud Dataprep Datetime values to BigQuery as Datetime or Timestamp values, depending on the data. See BigQuery Data Type Conversions.

Changed

Supported browser version required: You cannot login to the application using an unsupported version of Google Chrome.
Supported encoding types: The list of supported encoding types has changed.
Dependencies Browser: The Dependencies browser has been replaced by the Dataset Navigator.

Deprecated
Transform Editor: The Transform Editor for entering raw text Wrangle steps has been removed. Please use the Transform Builder for creating transformation steps.
Issue

TD-27568: Cannot select BigQuery publishing destinations that are empty databases.
TD-24312: Improved Error Messages for Google users to identify pre-job run failures. If an error is encountered during the launch of a job but before job execution, you can now view a detailed error message as to the cause in the failed job card. Common errors that occur during the launch of a job include:

Cloud Dataflow staging location is not writeable
Cloud Dataflow cannot read from and write to different regions
Insufficient workers for Cloud Dataflow, please check your quota

TD-24273: Circular reference in schema of Avro file causes job in Cloud Dataflow to fail.
TD-23635: Read-only BigQuery databases are listed as publishing destinations. Publish fails.

Fixed

TD-26177: Dataflow job fails for large avro files. Avro datasets that were imported before this release may still have failures during job execution on Dataflow. To fix these failures, you must re-import the dataset.
TD-25438: Deleting an upstream reference node does not propagate results correctly to the Transformer page.
TD-25419: When a pivot transform is applied, some column histograms may not be updated.
TD-23787: When publishing location is unavailable, spinning wheel hangs indefinitely without any error message.
TD-22467: Last active sample is not displayed during preview of multi-dataset operations.
TD-22128: Cannot read multi-file Avro stream if data is greater than 500 KB.
TD-19865: You cannot configure a publishing location to be a directory that does not already exist. See Run Job Page.
TD-17657: splitrows transform allows splitting even if required parameter on is set to an empty value.
TD-24464: 'Python Error' when opening recipe with large number of columns and a nest
TD-24322: Nest transform creates a map with duplication keys.
TD-23920 : Support for equals sign (=) in output path.
TD-23646: Adding a specific comment appears to invalidate earlier edit.
TD-23111: Long latency when loading complex flow views
TD-23099: View Results button is missing on Job Cards even with profiling enabled
TD-22889: Extremely slow UI performance for some actions

1.4.0
Feature
Maven projects that package a runnable JAR—for example, Spring Boot or Spark Java applications—can be deployed to the App Engine flexible environment Java runtime.
Feature
Individual WAR files and runnable JAR archives can be deployed to the App Engine flexible environment, whether created by Eclipse or not.
Feature
All google-cloud-java libraries can be added to Java 8 Eclipse projects and Java 7 non-App Engine projects. The subset of these libraries that work in the App Engine standard Java 7 runtime can be added to Java 7 App Engine projects.
Changed
Google managed library jars are now added to a single Google APIs container, rather than separate library containers.
Changed
Java 8 and Servlet 3.1 are now the default environment in the new project wizards. New projects should start with Java 8.
Changed
In native projects the App Engine SDK (com.google.appengine:appengine-sdk-1.0-api) is now included in the App Engine standard runtime definition, as it is in the server runtime.
Changed
The App Engine standard runtime no longer includes JSTL (jstl:jstl) to allow alternative implementations. If you need to add JSTL to an existing project, you can download the Apache Standard Tag Library jar from Maven Central and place it in your project's WEB-INF/lib directory.
Issue
App Engine standard environment projects that depend on classes from appengine-api-1.0-sdk.jar may encounter NoClassDefFoundErrors when running on the local server. Deployment and production environments are not affected.
To work around this in a Maven project, remove remove <scope>provided</scope> from the appengine-api-1.0-sdk dependency element in pom.xml. In a non-Maven project, copy the appengine-api-1.0-sdk.jar into the WEB-INF/lib folder and refresh the project. You can download this jar from Maven Central.
Issue
Adding the Endpoints library to your project will add a dependency on the Servlet API 2.5, even in Java 8 projects that already depend on the Servlet API 3.1.

The beta build pipeline has been updated:
Feature

Developers can now build their applications with a specific Go runtime version. For the beta build pipeline, specifying runtime: go in your app.yaml file will use the latest supported runtime version release, which is currently Go 1.9.

Feature

Produces an application image with gcr.io/distroless/base as the base image. This affects only new deployments, deployed with the gcloud beta app deploy command.

Explicit content detection: SafeSearch has been renamed to Explicit Content Detection. Explicit Content Detection inspects an input video for frame-level imagery that could be considered adult content.
Explicit Content Detection is performed by using the
annotate

EXPLICIT_CONTENT_DETECTION
request.
Changed
The
ExplicitContentAnnotation
and
ExplicitContentFrame
types replace the SafeSearchAnnotation type. The adult field has been renamed to pornographyLikelihood and the time field has been renamed to timeOffset. The spoof, medical, violent, and racy fields have also been removed. The timeOffset field returns a value of type Duration instead of type int64.
Changed
The labelAnnotations field returned in the response for a video annotation request has been replaced with the segmentLabelAnnotations, shotLabelAnnotations, and frameLabelAnnotations fields. This provides specific label annotations for each level of the video. The LabelLevel enum has been removed.
All annotations have been updated to return an array of
LabelFrame
types, an array of
LabelSegment
types, a list of entities, and a list of entity categories. Each LabelFrame and LabelSegment includes a confidence value.
The field description has been replaced with an
Entity
 type, which includes both the description and an entity_id field. You can use the entity id to find more information for some entities in the Google Knowledge Graph Search API.
The
LabelDetectionMode
enum remains unchanged and can be set as the label_detection_mode field of the
LabelDetectionConfig
for your request, along with the stationary_camera field. This configurations applies only to labels. Other video intelligence features do not yet have yet any feature-specific configuration options.

Welcome to the Cloud IAP general release for App Engine standard environment, Compute Engine, and GKE!
Issue
Cloud IAP for App Engine flexible environment is still in beta. This feature is not covered by any SLA or deprecation policy and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes for App Engine flexible environment.
Changed
Java code samples were updated with security enhancements on August 15, 2017. If you're using the Java signed headers code sample, please update your application per the current samples.
Changed
When you use the programmatic authentication feature, the aud claim in the JWT must now be the Cloud IAP client ID. Previously, it could also be the application URL. For applications that used programmatic authentication recently, we placed this feature on our whitelist. We will remove the functionality on November 15, 2017. For details and updated code samples, refer to programmatic authentication.
Changed
Due to internal security enhancements, App Engine standard environment apps no longer require login: required in app.yaml (or security-constraint for Java).
Feature
Forseti Security is now available and strongly encouraged for Compute Engine apps. If you have any questions or require assistance, please post to discuss@forsetisecurity.org.
Feature
Cloud IAP now supports Cloud Audit Logging. Learn about enabling Cloud Audit Logging.
Feature
Cloud IAP now supports desktop and command-line applications. Learn about authenticating from a desktop app.
Feature
AJAX requests with missing or expired credentials will now get an HTTP 401 response instead of being served a Google login page. "

The Cloud Translation API is no longer taking requests for access to the Premium Edition (Beta). Instead, the premium features of the Cloud Translation API have been made generally available in the Standard Edition.
Feature
You now have access to the robust translation features available using the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. There is no difference in pricing between the standard, Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) model, and the NMT model.
By default, when you make a translation request to the Cloud Translation API, your text is translated using the NMT model. If the NMT model is not supported for the requested language translation pair, or if you explicitly request it, the PBMT model is used.
In order for your request to be translated using the NMT model, you must send your request to the current Translation API endpoint: https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2. The https://www.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2 endpoint does not support the NMT model.
NMT models are computationally intensive and may take more time to translate your query as compared to the same query translated using the PBMT model. If your application is latency sensitive, we recommend that you try both models to determine which best fits your needs for response time.
Feature
The model query parameter has been added to the translate method. You can use the model parameter to explicitly specify the translation model for your request. Specify base to use the PBMT model, and nmt to use the NMT model.
If you do not specify a model parameter for your request, then nmt is used.
If you specify the nmt model, and the requested language translation pair is not supported for the NMT model, then the request is translated using the base model."

If you are NOT using CORS requests to your APIs, please ignore this announcement.Important: The changes in this release do not effect deployments on Google App Engine Standard.Background & Current BehaviorWith the CORS standard, a browser inserts an extra OPTIONS request to the server to determine whether it has permission to perform a cross-origin request. Currently the ESP always accepts OPTIONS requests. This means that currently ESP always allows cross-origin requests through CORS.Upcoming ChangesESP will allow service producers to specify whether or not to allow cross-origin traffic. By default, ESP will block cross-origin requests by rejecting all OPTIONS requests. If you want to allow cross-origin requests for your API, you will need to add the following snippet to the service's OpenAPI configuration....
""host"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",
""x-google-endpoints"": [
  {
    ""name"": ""echo-api.endpoints.YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloud.goog"",
    ""allowCors"": true
  }
],
...
Important: This is a breaking change. By default ESP will now reject cross-origin calls unless the above ""allowCors"" setting is applied.What You Need to DoNote: This change does not apply to App Engine Standard Environment. Standard Environment uses Endpoints Frameworks. CORS traffic is allowed on this platform.Follow the instructions in the appropriate tab below.
App Engine FlexAfter ESP 1.0 is released on January 2, 2017, all Flexible Environment API deployments will feature the new version of ESP and will automatically disallow CORS requests by default. App Engine applications are automatically redeployed every 7 days, so sometime in the 7 days following the release of ESP 1.0, your app will be restarted with the latest version and will automatically be protected from unintended cross origin sharing.
If you are using Flexible Environments and would like to continue to allow CORS requests, you must add the ""x-google-endpoints"" snippet above to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file). If you are relying on CORS, we recommend that you add the snippet as soon as possible and redeploy your service using the following command to avoid service interruption. Then you will not see changed behavior when the new version of ESP rolls out.
gcloud app deploy app.yaml

Kubernetes EngineWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.
Note: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.
If you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0 after January 2. Add the above ""x-google-endpoints"" snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml

Note that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.
Now you need to redeploy your service. You can use the following command, replacing ESP-DEPLOYMENT with the deployment name for your service.
kubectl edit deployment/ESP-DEPLOYMENT

This command opens up your GKE configuration YAML and let you update the deployment. Make sure to change your version of ESP to 1.0 and update the SERVICE_CONFIG_ID to the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, and save the deployment.
containers:
    - name: esp
      image: gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1.0
      args: [
        ""--http_port"", ""8080"",
        ""--backend"", ""localhost:8081"",
        ""--service"", ""SERVICE_NAME"",
        ""--version"", ""SERVICE_CONFIG_ID"",
      ]

Compute EngineWe plan to introduce this change in the ESP version 1.0 release on January 2, 2017.
Note: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.
If you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (aka OpenAPI specification aka Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0. Add the above ""x-google-endpoints"" snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml
Note that the above step pushed your new service config to the service manager. Note the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID, you will need it in the next step.
Before redeploying your service, you need to update the metadata entries on the VM with the following command:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata --metadata=endpoints-service-name=SERVICE_NAME,endpoints-service-config-id=SERVICE_CONFIG_ID

Then you need to SSH to the VM and run the following command to restart ESP.
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Alternatively, if you use the start_esp.py script to start ESP (instead of the init.d script), you can stop ESP and re-run the start_esp.py command with the updated SERVICE_CONFIG_ID.
Compute Engine + DockerWe plan to introduce this change in the version 1.0 release of ESP on January 2, 2017.
Note: If you do not use CORS to allow cross-origin traffic to your API, you do not need to change your API configuration. You may wish to upgrade your ESP to block any CORS requests.
If you are currently using CORS to enable cross-origin traffic to your API, you will need to make changes to your API configuration (known as the OpenAPI specification or Swagger file) when you upgrade ESP to version 1.0. Add the above x-google-endpoints snippets to the OpenAPI config for your API, and re-deploy your API configuration using the following command.
gcloud service-management deploy openapi.yaml

This pushes your new service config to Google Service Management. That command will return a new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for your API. Note it down because you will need it in the next step.
Next, redeploy your service. First stop and remove the current ESP instance (e.g., ""esp"") using the following commands. You can use sudo docker ps command to find out the current ESP instance.
sudo docker stop esp
sudo docker rm esp

Then, run the following command to redeploy ESP. Make sure to use the new SERVICE_CONFIG_ID for -v option.
sudo docker run --name=esp -d -p 80:8080 --link=echo:echo gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1.0 -s [SERVICE_NAME] -v [SERVICE_CONFIG_ID] -a echo:8081

When committing a cross-group transaction, version numbers returned for new or updated entities are all the same. With the previous behavior, entities within the same group committed as part of a cross-group transaction, had the same version number, but entities in different groups might have had different version numbers. This change ensures all new and updated entities have an identical version number, regardless of their entity group, when committed as part of a cross-group transaction. As before, entities that are not updated will not have a new version number.

Initial release of Cloud Datastore API v1beta3.
Changes to the API definition:

The API is now defined in three proto files: entity.proto, query.proto, and datastore.proto.
The proto files now use proto3 syntax:

Maps are used for several fields (see below for details).
All enums add a value with suffix _UNSPECIFIED that is equal to 0.
oneof is used to prevent setting mutually-exclusive fields:

Fields id and name in message PathElement.
The value fields in message Value.
Fields composite_filter and property_filter in type Filter.
Fields value and cursor in message GqlQueryParameter.
Fields upsert, update, upsert, and delete in message Mutation.


All request messages add a top-level field project_id. This field is populated automatically for requests made over HTTP.
Several repeated fields now have plural names:

In message CompositeFilter, filter is now filters.
In message QueryResultBatch, entity_result is now entity_results.
In message LookupRequest, key is now keys.
In message AllocateIdsRequest, key is now keys.
In message AllocateIdsResponse, key is now keys.

The proto package name now includes the API version.
In message PartitionId:

Field dataset_id is now project_id. project_id never includes the app/project ID ""prefix"" (e.g. ""s~""). This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/59.
Field namespace is now namespace_id.

In message Key, field path_element is now path.
In message Value:

Null values are represented by explicitly setting field null_value with type com.protobuf.NullValue. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.
Field timestamp_microseconds_value is now timestamp_value with type google.protobuf.Timestamp. In JSON, the field dateTimeValue is now timestampValue. This field is still limited to microsecond precision.
Field blob_key_value is removed. Values that previously populated that field in the v1beta1 or v1beta2 APIs will instead populate field string_value in the v1beta3 API.
Field geo_point_value of type google.type.LatLng is added.
Repeated field list_value is replaced with array_value of type ArrayValue.
Field indexed, which defaulted to true, is now exclude_from_indexes, which defaults to false.

Message Property is removed. In message Entity, repeated field property is now field properties which is a map from string to Value.
Message PropertyExpression is now Projection.
Message EntityResult adds a field cursor of type bytes.
In message Query:

Field group_by is now distinct_on.
Field limit is now of type google.protobuf.Int32Value.

In message PropertyExpression, enum AggregationFunction and field aggregation_function are removed.
In messages CompositeFilter and PropertyFilter, field operator is now op.
In message GqlQuery:

Field allow_literal is now allow_literals.
Repeated field name_arg is now map field named_bindings.
Field number_arg is now positional_bindings.

Message GqlQueryArg is now GqlQueryParameter. Field name is removed.
Enum MoreResultsType adds a new value MORE_RESULTS_AFTER_CURSOR.
Message QueryResultBatch adds field skipped_cursor.
In message Mutation:

A Mutation now describes one change to one single entity. Its fields are no longer repeated.
Field insert_auto_id is removed. insert and update mutations now support auto ID allocation.
Field force is removed.

In message MutationResult:

Field index_updates is moved to message CommitResponse.
Repeated field insert_auto_id_key is now key and is no longer repeated.

Message RunQueryResponse adds field query. When a RunQueryRequest message sets field gql_query, the RunQueryResponse message sets field query to the parsed form of the GqlQuery message from the request.
In message BeginTransactionRequest, enum IsolationLevel and field isolation_level are removed. All transactions are now serializable.
In message CommitRequest, field mutation is now repeated field mutations.
In message CommitResponse, field mutation_result is now repeated field mutation_results.

Changes to the JSON API:

Null values are now supported. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/41.
Fields set to their default values are not included in responses, for example:

Fields found, missing, and deferred in message to LookupResponse are not included when they are empty.
Field entity_result in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is empty.
Field skipped_results in message QueryResultBatch is not included when it is 0.


The API endpoint format has changed. For example, in v1beta2, a RunQuery is sent to: https://www.googleapis.com/datastore/v1beta2/datasets/<dataset-id>/runQuery
In v1beta3, it is sent to:
https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1beta3/projects/<project-id>:runQuery
Account domain restrictions no longer apply when accessing the API. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.
Errors:

JSON errors add a status field and remove the errors list.
Errors resulting from requests with a content type of application/x-protobuf are now a serialized google.rpc.Status message.

Changes to GQL:

In synthetic literal KEY, DATASET is now PROJECT.
The BLOBKEY synthetic literal is removed.
The FIRST aggregator is removed.
The GROUP BY clause is replaced with DISTINCT ON.
Fully-qualified property names are now supported.
Query filters on timestamps prior to the epoch are now supported.

Empty array values are now supported.
Indexing and querying properties inside of entity values is now supported. Values inside entity values are indexed by default.
Key normalization:

In Key objects in RunQueryRequests, key normalization will never set partition_id.namespace_id, as it previously did under some circumstances. If a key should reference that partition its partition_id.namespace_id must be explicitly set.
Key objects with empty path and empty or unset partition_id are no longer normalized.

Writes of foreign partition IDs may now fail if the foreign project is not in an active state. For this reason, use of foreign partition IDs is discouraged.
In a non-transactional Commit requests, no two mutations may affect the same entity.
In transactional Commit requests, mutations affecting the same entity are applied in the order in which they appear in the request. Certain sequences of mutations affecting the same entity are not permitted.
Field more_results in message QueryResultBatch is accurate in more cases. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/48.
The typical number of results returned by a call to RunQuery is smaller due to a change in server-side batching. As before, clients should not rely on the batch size and instead use cursors to continue queries.
Scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email is no longer required.
The API works for projects that have an App Engine domain restriction. This fixes https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-datastore/issues/19.
gcd tool:

Options -d, --dataset_id, and --dataset_id_override are now -p, --project_id, and --project_id_override, respectively.
Option --auth_mode is removed. The updateindexes and vacuumindexes commands always use OAuth 2.0.
Option --auto_generate_indexes is now --store_index_configuration_on_disk.
Index configuration for new projects is now stored in a YAML file: <directory>/WEB-INF/index.yaml. Index configuration for projects that previously used XML will continue to do so.

Anthos Config Management now can optionally support an unstructured repository, though some features that relied on hierarchical namespaces are disabled in this mode.
Feature
Git repos with submodules are now also supported by Anthos Configuration Management out of the box without additional configuration. This allows delegation of config authoring in a Git-idiomatic way. For more information, please see Git's documentation on submodules.
Feature
A new CLI subcommand is available. nomos bugreport bundles up Anthos Config Management log information into a Zip file, which can be attached to a Google support ticket.
Fixed issuesFixed
Previously, adding an APIService to the repo will leave Anthos Config Management in a bad state, with the error message ""KNV2002: failed to get server resources: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs."" This issue has been mitigated; Anthos Config Management will now sync APIService objects correctly.
Known issuesIssue
It is not currently possible to downgrade to v1.0.x after upgrading to a more recent version of Anthos Config Management.
Issue
Currently, Config Connector can only be installed on a single cluster. If multiple Config Connector instances attempt to create or mutate the same Google Cloud resource, conflicts or errors may occur, and you may exhaust quota for a given resource."

Policy Controller (Beta) is a Kubernetes dynamic admission controller that checks, audits, and enforces your clusters' compliance with policies related to security, regulations, or business rules. It is built using Gatekeeper, an open source project.
Feature
You can now enable integration with Config Connector (beta), a Kubernetes addon that allows you to manage your Google Cloud resources through Kubernetes configuration. You can sync configs for Google Cloud resources with your Anthos Config Management repo and apply them automatically. For more information, see Installing Config Connector.
ChangesChanged
The apiVersion for the ConfigManagement CustomResource has changed. No action is required; the CustomResource is upgraded automatically when you upgrade to v1.1.0. You can read more about configuring Anthos Config Management.
Changed
Managed CRDs (CustomResourceDefinitions) are now Namespace-scoped by default, instead of cluster-scoped. This matches the semantics of the kubectl command.
If a CRD explicitly specifies a scope, Anthos Config Management honors that scope.
Changed
The nomos hydrate command is a replacement for the nomos view command, and reports your Anthos Config Management configuration in a human-readable way.
To use nomos hydrate, upgrade the nomos command to v1.1.
If you need to continue using nomos view, do not upgrade the nomos command from v1.0. It will remain forward-compatible for the foreseeable future.
You can read about a known issue with nomos view.
Changed
Anthos Config Management can now be installed on clusters using PodSecurityPolicies.
DeprecationsDeprecated

Feature
We document how to stop Anthos Config Management from syncing configs as quickly as possible. This allows you to mitigate the potential for propagating unintended configs to clusters.
Feature
The new nomos status subcommand provides a top-level view of the state of Anthos Config Management on all enrolled clusters, including errors and sync status. It reports on all clusters that kubectl can access.
ChangesChanged
The product name is now Anthos Config Management.
Changed
The nomos version command now provides version details for the Config Management Operator on each configured cluster, as well as the version of the nomos command itself.
Changed
New metrics allow you to monitor counts, latencies, and timestamps of specific operations.
Changed
The following changes have been made to the canonical example repository:
The canonical example repo has moved. If you use this repo or a fork, update the your Git repository's remotes or create a separate clone of the new repo to ensure that you receive updates.
The filesystem standard and the value of the Repo object's spec.version for this version of Anthos Config Management are both `1.0.0`.
A new branch named `1.0.0` contains configs compatible with Anthos Config Management v1.0.0.
